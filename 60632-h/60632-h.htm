<p>The custom which has ordained that a book
shall have a preface is useful enough to writers
who have to say to their readers something which
could not properly be said in the body of the text;
but it imposes a burden upon those who have no
such communication to make. The author of the
present volume considers that he may fairly perform
the task by remarking that if the tales herein
contained are not so amusing as others he has
written, they will perhaps be found to be quite as
entertaining, and possibly, in some particulars,
more instructive. If they shall be received by the
public with the favor that was found by the preceding
volumes, the author will have reason to congratulate
himself that they have achieved success
of a somewhat remarkable character.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ISLAND.</span></h3>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_009.png" width="66" height="68" alt="W" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">When</span> the good ship “Morning Star,”
bound to Liverpool from New York,
foundered at sea, the officers, the crew,
and all of the passengers but two, escaped in the
boats. Professor E. L. Baffin and his daughter,
Matilda Baffin, preferred to intrust themselves to
a patent india-rubber life-raft, which the Professor
was carrying with him to Europe, with the hope
that he should sell certain patent rights in the contrivance.</p>

<p>There was time enough, before the ship sank, to
inflate the raft and to place upon it all of the
trunks and bundles belonging to the Professor and
Matilda. These were lashed firmly to the rubber
cylinders, and thus Professor Baffin was encouraged
to believe that he might save from destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
all of the scientific implements and apparatus
which he had brought with him from the Wingohocking
University to illustrate the course of lectures
which he had engaged to give in England
and Scotland.</p>

<p>Having made the luggage fast, the Professor
handed Matilda down from the ship’s side, and
when he had tied her to one of the trunks and
secured himself to another, he cut the raft adrift,
and, with the occupants of the boats, sorrowfully
watched the brave old “Morning Star” settle
down deeper and deeper into the water; until at
last, with a final plunge, she dipped beneath the
surface and disappeared.</p>

<p>The prospect was a cheerless one for all of the
party. The sea was not dangerously rough; but
the captain estimated that the nearest land was at
least eight hundred miles distant; and, although
there were in the boats and upon the raft provisions
and water enough for several days, the
chance was small that a port could be made before
the supplies should be exhausted. There was,
moreover, almost a certainty that the boats would be
swamped if they should encounter a severe storm.</p>

<p>The Professor, for his part, felt confident that
the raft would outlive any storm; but his shipmates
regarded his confidence in it as an indication
of partial insanity.</p>

<p>The captain rested his expectations of getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
ashore chiefly upon the fact that they were in the
line of greatest travel across the Atlantic, so that
they might reasonably look to meet, within a day
or two, with a vessel of some kind which would
rescue them.</p>

<p>As the night came on, it was agreed that the
boats and the raft should keep together, and the
captain had provided a lantern, which was swung,
lighted, aloft upon an oar, so that the position of
his boat could be determined. The Professor, with
his raft under sail, steered along in the wake of the
boats for several hours, Matilda, meanwhile, sleeping
calmly, after the exciting and exhausting labors
of the day, upon a couple of trunks.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, a brisk wind sprang up,
and shortly afterward the light upon the captain’s
boat for some reason disappeared. The Professor
was somewhat perplexed when he missed it, but he
concluded that the safest plan would be to steer
about upon the course he had hitherto held, and
then to communicate with the boats if they should
be within sight in the morning.</p>

<p>The wind increased in force about midnight, and
the raft rolled and pitched in such a manner that
the Professor’s faith in it really lost some of its
force. Several times huge waves swept over it,
drenching the Professor and his daughter, and filling
them with grave apprehensions of the result if
the storm should become more violent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Even amid the peril, however, Professor Baffin
could not but admire the heroic courage and composure
of Matilda, who sat upon her trunk, wet
and shivering with cold, without showing a sign of
fear, but trying to encourage her father with words
of hope and cheer.</p>

<p>When the dawn came, dim and gray, the gale
abated its force, and although the sea continued
rough, the raft rode the waves more buoyantly and
easily. Producing some matches from his waterproof
box, the Professor lighted the kerosene-lamp
in the tiny stove which was in one of the boxes;
and then Matilda, with water from the barrel, began
to try to make some coffee. The attempt
seemed to promise to be successful, and while the
process was going on, the Professor looked about
for the boats. They could not be seen. The Professor
took out his glass and swept the horizon.
In vain; the boats had disappeared completely;
but the Professor saw something else that attracted
his attention, and made his heart for a moment
stop beating.</p>

<p>Right ahead, not distinctly outlined, but visible in
a misty sort of way, he thought he discerned
land!</p>

<p>At first he could not believe the evidence of his
sight. The captain, an expert navigator, had assured
him that they were eight hundred miles from
any shore. But this certainly looked to the Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
very much like land. He examined it through
his glass. Even then the view was not clear enough
to remove all doubts, but it strengthened his conviction;
and when Matilda looked she said she
knew it was land. She could trace the outline of a
range of hills.</p>

<p>“Tilly,” said the Professor, “we are saved! It <em>is</em>
the land, and the raft is drifting us directly towards
it. We cannot be sufficiently thankful, my child,
for this great mercy! Who would have expected
it? Taken altogether, it is the most extraordinary
circumstance within my recollection.”</p>

<p>“Captain Duffer must have made a miscalculation,”
said Tilly. “The ship must have been off
of her course when she sprang a leak.”</p>

<p>“It is incomprehensible how so old a sailor could
have made such a blunder,” replied the Professor.
“But there the land is; I can see it now distinctly.
It looks to me like a very large island.”</p>

<p>“Are you going ashore at once, pa?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, dear; that is, if we can make a landing
through the breakers.”</p>

<p>“Suppose there are cannibals on it, pa? It would
be horrid to have them eat us!”</p>

<p>“They would have to fatten us first, darling;
and that would give us an opportunity to study
their habits. It would be extremely interesting!”</p>

<p>“But the study would be of no use if they should
eat us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
“All knowledge is useful, Tilly; I could write
out the results of our observations, and probably
set them adrift in a bottle!”</p>

<p>“It is such a dreadful death!”</p>

<p>“Try to look at it philosophically! There is
really nothing more unpleasant about the idea of
being digested than there is about the thought of
being buried.”</p>

<p>“O, pa!”</p>

<p>“No, my child! It is merely a sentiment. If I
shall be eaten, and we have volition after death, I
am determined to know how I agreed with the man
who had me for dinner! Tilly, I have a notion
that you would eat tender!”</p>

<p>“Pa, you are simply awful!”</p>

<p>“To me, indeed, there is something inspiring in
the thought that my physical substance, when I
have done with it, should nourish the vitality of
another being. I don’t like to think that I may be
wasted.”</p>

<p>“You seem as if you rather hoped we should find
savage cannibals upon the island!”</p>

<p>“No, Tilly; I hope we shall not. I believe we
shall not. Man-eaters are rarely found in this latitude.
My impression is that the island is not inhabited
at all. Probably it is of recent volcanic
origin. If so, we may have a chance to examine
a newly-formed crater. I have longed to do so for
years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
“We might as well be eaten as to be blown up
and burned up by a volcano,” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“It would be a grand thing, though, to be permitted
to observe, without interruption, the operation
of one of the mightiest forces of nature! I could
make a magnificent report to the Philosophical Society
about it; that is, if we should ever get home
again.”</p>

<p>“For my part,” said Matilda, “I hope it contains
neither cannibals nor volcanoes; I hope it is simply
a charming island without a man or a beast
upon it.”</p>

<p>“Something like Robinson Crusoe’s, for example!
I have often thought I should like to undergo his
experiences. It must be, to an inquiring mind,
exceedingly instructive to observe in what manner
a civilized man, thrown absolutely upon his own
resources, contrives to conduct his existence. I
could probably enrich my lecture upon Sociology
if we should be compelled to remain upon the
island for a year or two.”</p>

<p>“But we should starve to death in that time!”</p>

<p>“So we should; unless, indeed, the island produces
fruits of some kind from its soil. I think it
does. It seems to be covered with trees, Tilly,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Matilda, looking through the glass.
“It is a mass of verdure. It is perfectly beautiful. I
believe I see something that looks like a building, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
“Impossible! you see a peculiar rock formation,
no doubt; I shan’t be surprised if there is enough
in the geological formation of the island to engage
my attention so long as we remain.”</p>

<p>“But what am I to do, meantime?”</p>

<p>“You? Oh, you can label my specimens and
keep the journal; and maybe you might hunt
around for fossils a little yourself.”</p>

<p>The raft rapidly moved toward the shore, and
the eyes of both of the voyagers were turned toward
it inquiringly and eagerly. Who could tell
how long the island might be their home, and what
strange adventures might befall them there?</p>

<p>“The wind is blowing right on shore, Tilly,”
said the Professor. “I will steer straight ahead,
and I shouldn’t wonder if we could shoot the
breakers safely. Isn’t that a sand-beach right in
front there?” inquired the Professor, elevating his
nose a little, to get his spectacles in focus. “It
looks like one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” replied Matilda, looking through her
glass.</p>

<p>“First-rate! Couldn’t have been better. There,
we will drive right in. Tilly, hoist my umbrella, so
as to give her more sail!”</p>

<p>The raft fairly danced across the waves under
the increased pressure, and in a moment or two it
was rolling in the swell just outside of the line of
white breakers. Before the Professor had time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
think what he should do to avoid the shock, a huge
wave uplifted the raft and ran it high upon the
beach with such violence as to compel the Professor
to turn a somersault over a trunk. He recovered
himself at once, and replacing his spectacles
he proceeded, with the assistance of Matilda, to
pull the raft up beyond the reach of the waves.</p>

<p>Then, wet and draggled, with sand on his coat,
and his hat knocked completely out of shape, he
stood rubbing his chin with his hand, and thoughtfully
observing the breakers.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary force, Tilly, that of the ocean
surf,—clear waste, too, apparently. If we stay here
long enough, I must try to find out the secret of its
motion.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better put on some dry clothing
first?” suggested Miss Baffin, “and examine the
surf afterwards? For my part I have had enough
of it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Have you the keys of the trunks?
Everything soaking wet, most likely.”</p>

<p>When the trunks were unfastened, the Professor
was delighted to find that the contents were perfectly
dry. Selecting some clothing for himself, he
went behind a huge rock and proceeded to dress.
Matilda, after looking carefully about, retreated to
a group of trees, and beneath their shelter made
her toilette.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a magnificent place?” said the Professor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
when Matilda, nicely dressed, came out to
where he was standing by the raft.</p>

<p>“Perfectly lovely.”</p>

<p>“Noble trees, rich grass, millions of wild flowers,
birds twittering above us, a matchless sky, a bracing
air, and—why, halloa! there’s a stream of
running water! We must have a drink of that,
the very first thing. Delicious, isn’t it?” asked
the Professor, when Miss Baffin, after drinking,
returned the cup to him.</p>

<p>“It is nectar.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Tilly, I am not sure that it
wouldn’t be a good thing to be compelled to live
here for two or three years. The vegetation shows
that we are in a temperate latitude, and I know I can
find or raise enough to eat in such a place as this.”</p>

<p>“Why, pa, look there!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Over there. Don’t you see that castle?”</p>

<p>“Castle? No! What! Why, yes, it is! Bless
my soul, Tilly, the place is inhabited!”</p>

<p>“Who would have thought of finding a building
like that on an island in mid-ocean?”</p>

<p>“It is the most extraordinary circumstance,
taking it altogether, that ever came under my observation,”
said the Professor, looking towards the
distant edifice. “So far as I can make out, it is a
castle of an early period.”</p>

<p>“Mediæval?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
“Well, not later than the seventh or eighth century,
at the farthest. Tilly, I feel as if something
remarkable was going to happen.”</p>

<p>“Pa, you frighten me!”</p>

<p>“No, I mean something that will be extraordinarily
interesting. I know it. The voice of instinct
tells me so. Have you your journal with you?”</p>

<p>“It is in the trunk.”</p>

<p>“Get it and your lead-pencils. We will drag the
baggage further up from the water, and then we
will push towards the castle. I am going to know
the date of that structure before I sleep to-night.”</p>

<p>“There can hardly be any danger, I suppose?”
suggested Miss Baffin, rather timidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, of course not; I have my revolver with
me. Let me see; where is it? Ah, here. And
the cartridges are waterproof. I think I will put a
few things in a valise, also. We might find the
castle empty, and have to depend upon ourselves
for supper.”</p>

<p>The Professor then let the air out of the raft,
and folded the flattened cylinders together.</p>

<p>When the valise was ready, the Professor
grasped it, shouldered his umbrella, and said,
“Now, come, darling, and we will find out what all
this means.”</p>

<p>The pair started along a broad path which ran
by the side of the stream, following the course of
the brook, and winding in and out among trees of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
huge girth and gigantic height. Birds of familiar
species flitted from branch to branch before them,
as if to lead them on their way; now and then a
brown rabbit, after eyeing them for a moment with
quivering nostrils, beat a quick tattoo upon the
ground with his hind legs, then threw up his tail
and whisked into the shrubbery. Gray squirrels
scrambled around the trunks of the trees to look
at them, and now and then a screaming, blue-crested
kingfisher ceased his complaining while he
plunged into one of the pools of the rivulet, and
emerged with a trout in his talons.</p>

<p>It was an enchanting scene; and Miss Baffin
enjoyed it thoroughly as she stepped blithely by
the side of her father, who seemed to find especial
pleasure in discovering that the herbage, the trees,
the rocks, and all the other natural objects, were
precisely like those with which he had been familiar
at home.</p>

<p>After following the path for some time, the pair
came to a place where the brook widened into a
great pool, through which the water went sluggishly,
bearing upon its surface bubbles and froth,
which told how it had been tossed and broken by
rapid descents over the rocks in some narrow
channel above. Here the Professor stopped to observe
an uncommonly large and green bullfrog,
which sat upon a slimy stone a few yards away,
looking solemnly at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
During the pause, they were startled to hear a
voice saying to <span class="locked">them,—</span></p>

<p>“Good morrow, gentle friends.”</p>

<p>Matilda uttered a partly-suppressed scream, and
even the Professor jumped backward a foot or two,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>Looking toward the place from which the voice
came, they saw an old man with gray hair and
beard lifting a large stone pitcher, which he had
been filling from the pool. He was dressed in a
long and rather loose robe, which reached from
his shoulders to his feet, and which was gathered
about his waist with a knotted cord. This was
his entire costume, for his feet were bare, and he
wore no hat to hide the rich masses of hair which
fell to his shoulders. As he offered his salutation,
he raised his pitcher until he stood upright, and
then he looked at the Professor and Miss Baffin
with a pleasant smile, in which there were traces
of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” returned the Professor, after
a moment’s hesitation; “how are you?”</p>

<p>“Are you not strangers in this land?” asked the
old man.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said the Professor, briskly, with a
manifest purpose to be sociable; “we have just
come ashore down here on the beach. Shipwrecked,
in fact. This is my daughter. Let me
introduce you. My child, allow me to make you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
acquainted with—with—beg pardon, but I think
you did not mention your name.”</p>

<p>“I am known as Father Anselm.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed! Matilda, this is Father Anselm.
A clergyman, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I am a hermit; my cell is close at hand. You
will be welcome there if you will visit it.”</p>

<p>“A hermit! Living in a cell! Well, this <em>is</em>
surprising! We shall be only too happy to visit
you, if you will permit us. Delightful, isn’t it,
dear? We will obtain some valuable information
from the old gentleman.”</p>

<p>The Hermit, with the pitcher poised upon his
shoulder, led the way, and he was closely followed
by the Professor and by Matilda, who regarded
the proceeding rather with nervous apprehension.
The Hermit’s cell was a huge cave, excavated from
the side of a hill. The floor was covered with
sprigs of fragrant evergreens. A small table stood
upon one side of the apartment; beside it was a
rough bench, which was the only seat in the room.
A crucifix, a candle, a skull, an hour-glass, and a
few simple utensils were the only other articles to
be seen.</p>

<p>The Hermit brought forward the bench for his
visitors to sit upon, and then, procuring a cup, he
offered each a drink of water.</p>

<p>The Professor, hugging one knee with interlocked
fingers, seemed anxious to open a conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
“Pardon me, sir, but do I understand that you
are a clergyman; that is to say, some sort of a
teacher of religion?”</p>

<p>“I belong to a religious order. I am a recluse.”</p>

<p>“Roman Catholic, I presume?” said the Professor,
glancing at the crucifix.</p>

<p>“Your meaning is not wholly clear to me,” replied
the Hermit.</p>

<p>“What are your views? Do you lean to Calvinism,
or do you think the Arminians, upon the
whole, have the best of the argument?”</p>

<p>“The gentleman does not understand you, pa,”
said Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“Never mind, then; we will not press it. But
I should like very much if you would tell us something
about this place; this country around here,”
said the Professor, waving his hand towards the
door.</p>

<p>“Let me ask first of the misadventure which
cast you unwillingly upon our shores?” said the
Hermit.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I sailed from New York on the
twenty-third of last month, with my daughter here,
to fulfil an engagement to deliver a course of lectures
in England.”</p>

<p>“In England!” exclaimed the Hermit, with an
appearance of eager interest.</p>

<p>“Yes, in England. I am a professor, you know,
in an American university. When we were about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
half way across, the ship sprang a leak, from some
cause now unknown. My daughter and I got off
with our baggage upon a life-raft, which I most
fortunately had with me. The rest of the passengers
and the crew escaped in the boats. I became
separated from them, and drifted here. That
is the whole story.”</p>

<p>“I comprehend only a part of what you say,”
replied the Hermit. “But it is enough that you
have suffered; I give you hearty welcome.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And now tell me where I am.”</p>

<p>“You spoke of England a moment ago,” said
the Hermit. “Let me begin with it. Hundreds
of years ago, in the time of King Arthur, of noble
fame, it happened, by some means even yet not revealed
to us, that a vast portion of that island
separated from the rest, and drifted far out upon
the ocean. It carried with it hundreds of people—noble,
and gentle, and humble. This is that
country.”</p>

<p>“In-<em>deed</em>!” exclaimed the Professor. “This?
This island that we are on? Amazing!”</p>

<p>“It is true,” responded the Hermit.</p>

<p>“Why, Tilly, do you hear that? This is the lost
Atlantis! We have been driven ashore on the far-famed
Fortunate Island! Wonderful, isn’t it?
Taking every thing into consideration, I must say
this certainly is the most extraordinary circumstance
I ever encountered!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
“Nobody among us has ever heard anything
from England or of it, excepting through tradition.
No ship comes to our shores, and those of us who
have builded boats and gone away in search of
adventure have never come back. Sometimes I
think the island has not ended its wanderings, but
is still floating about; but we cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir,” said the Professor, “you can
take your latitude and longitude at any time, can’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Take what?”</p>

<p>“Your latitude and longitude! Find out exactly
in what part of the world you are?”</p>

<p>“I never heard that such a thing was done.
None of our people have that kind of learning.”</p>

<p>“Well, but you have schools and colleges, and
you acquire knowledge, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“We have a few schools; but only the low-born
children attend them, and they are taught only
what their fathers learned. We do not try to know
more. We reverence the past. It is a matter of
pride among us to preserve the habits, the manners,
the ideas, the social state which our fore-fathers
had when they were sundered from their
nation.”</p>

<p>“You live here pretty much as King Arthur and
his subjects lived?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We have our chivalry; our knight errants;
our tournaments; our castles—everything
just as it was in the old time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
“My dear,” said the Professor to Miss Baffin,
“the wildest imagination could have conceived
nothing like this. We shall be afforded an opportunity
to study the middle ages on the spot.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” said the Hermit, gravely, “I have
secret doubts whether our way is the best,
whether in England and the rest of the world
men may not have learned while we have remained
ignorant; but I cannot tell. And no one would be
willing to change if we could know the truth.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the Professor, with a look of
compassion, “the world has gone far, far ahead of
King Arthur’s time! It has almost forgotten that
there ever was such a time. You would hardly believe
me, at any rate you would not understand me,
if I should tell you of the present state of things in
the world. But if I stay here I will try to enlighten
you gradually. I feel as if I had been sent
here as a missionary for that very purpose.”</p>

<p>“Do you come from England?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I was going thither. I came from
the United States. You never heard of them, of
course. They are a land right across the ocean
from England, about three thousand miles.”</p>

<p>“Discovered by a man named Columbus,” said
Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“Your dress is an odd one,” continued the Hermit.
“Are you a fighting man?”</p>

<p>“A fighting man! Oh, no, of course not. I’m
a Professor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
“Then this is not a weapon that you carry.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, my dear sir! Why, this is an
umbrella! Tilly, we have to deal with a very
primitive condition of things here. It is both entertaining
and instructive.”</p>

<p>“What is it for?”</p>

<p>“I will show you. Suppose it begins to rain, I
untie this string and open the umbrella, <em>so</em>! Now
don’t be alarmed! It is perfectly harmless, I
assure you!”</p>

<p>The holy man had retreated suddenly into the
furthest recess of the cell.</p>

<p>“While it rains I hold it in this manner. When
it clears, I shut it up, <em>thus</em>, and put it under my
arm.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful! wonderful!” exclaimed the Hermit.
“I thought it was an implement of war. The
world beyond us evidently has surpassed us.”</p>

<p>“This is nothing to the things I will show you,”
said the Professor. “I see you have an hour-glass
here. Is this the only way you have of recording
time?”</p>

<p>“We have the sun.”</p>

<p>“No clocks or watches?”</p>

<p>“I do not know what they are.”</p>

<p>“Tilly, show him your watch. This is the machine
with which we tell time.”</p>

<p>“Alive, is it?” asked the Hermit.</p>

<p>The Professor explained the mechanism to him
in detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
“You are indeed a learned man,” said the recluse.
“But I have forgotten a part of my duty.
Will you not take some food?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Professor, “if you have anything
about in the form of a lunch, I think I could
dispose of it.”</p>

<p>“I am awfully hungry,” said Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>The Hermit produced a piece of meat, and hanging
it upon a turnspit he gathered a few sticks and
placed them beneath it. The Professor watched
him closely; and when the holy man took in his
hands a flint and steel with which to ignite the
wood, the Professor <span class="locked">exclaimed,—</span></p>

<p>“One moment! Let me start that fire for
you?”</p>

<p>Taking from his pocket an old newspaper, he
put it beneath the sticks; then from his match-box
he took a match, and striking it there was a blaze
in a moment.</p>

<p>The Hermit crossed himself and muttered a
prayer at this performance.</p>

<p>“No cause for alarm, I assure you,” said the
Professor.</p>

<p>“You must be a wizard,” said the Hermit.</p>

<p>“No; I did that with what we call a match; like
this one. There is stuff on the end which catches
fire when you rub it,” and the Professor again
ignited a match.</p>

<p>“I never could have dreamed that such a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
could be,” exclaimed the recluse. “You will be
regarded by our people as the most marvellous
magician that ever lived.”</p>

<p>The Professor laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he, “I will let them know it is not
magic. We must clear all that nonsense away.
Tilly, I feel that duty points me clearly to the task
of delivering a course of lectures upon this island.”</p>

<p>During the repast, the Hermit, looking timidly
at Professor Baffin, <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Would it seem discourteous if I should ask you
another question?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. I shall be glad to give you any
information you may want.”</p>

<p>“What, then,” inquired the Hermit, “is the
reason why you protect your eyes with glass windows?”</p>

<p>“These,” said the Professor, removing his spectacles,
“are intended to improve the sight. I
cannot see well without them. With them I have
perfect vision. Tilly, make a memorandum in the
journal that my first lecture shall be upon Optics.”</p>

<p>“Pa, I wish we could learn something about the
castle we saw,” observed Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; by the way, Father Anselm,” said the
Professor, “we observed an old-fashioned castle
over yonder, as we came here. Can you tell me
anything about it?”</p>

<p>“The castle,” replied the Hermit, “is the home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
and the stronghold of Sir Bors, Baron of Lonazep.
He is a great and powerful noble, much feared in
this country.”</p>

<p>“Any family?” inquired the Professor.</p>

<p>“He has a gallant son, Sir Dinadan, as brave a
knight as ever levelled lance, and a beautiful
daughter, Ysolt. Both are unmarried; but the fair
Ysolt fondly loves Sir Bleoberis, to whom, however,
the Baron will not suffer her to be wedded,
because Sir Bleoberis, though bold and skilful, has
little wealth.”</p>

<p>“Human nature, you observe, my child, is the
same everywhere. We have heard of something
like this at home,” remarked the Professor to his
daughter.</p>

<p>“Ysolt is loved also by another knight, Sir Dagonet.
He has great riches, and is very powerful;
but he is a bad and dangerous man, and the Baron
will not consent to give him Ysolt to wife. These
matters cause much strife and much unhappiness.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same way with us,” observed the Professor;
“I have known lots of such cases.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shall stay here long enough to see
how it all turns out,” said Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied the Professor. “You hated
the island when you thought it might promote the
interests of science. But some lovers’ nonsense
would keep you here willingly for life. Just like a
woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
“The King,” said the Hermit, “has espoused
the cause of Sir Bleoberis, and we hope he may
win the lady for the knight whom she loves.”</p>

<p>“The King, eh? Then you have a monarchical
government?”</p>

<p>“We have eleven kings upon this island.”</p>

<p>“All reigning?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How many people are there in the whole
island?”</p>

<p>“No one knows, exactly. One hundred thousand,
possibly.”</p>

<p>“Not ten thousand men apiece for the kings!
Humph! In my country we have a million men
in one town, and nobody but a common man to
rule them.”</p>

<p>“Incredible!”</p>

<p>“And what is the name of your particular king,—the
one who is lord of this part of the country?”</p>

<p>“King Brandegore; a wise, and good, and valiant
monarch.”</p>

<p>“Tilly,” said the Professor, “you might as well
jot that down. Eleven kings on the island, and
King Brandegore running this part of the government.
I must get acquainted with him.”</p>

<p>When the meal was finished the Professor said
to the <span class="locked">recluse,—</span></p>

<p>“Do you allow smoking?”</p>

<p>“Smoking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
“Pray excuse me! I forgot. If you will permit
me, I will introduce you to another of the practices
of modern civilization.”</p>

<p>Then the Professor lighted a cigar, and, sitting
on the bench in a comfortable position, with his
back against the wall of the cave, he began to puff
out whiffs of smoke.</p>

<p>The Hermit, with a look of alarm, was about to
ask for an explanation of the performance, when
loud cries were heard outside of the cave mingled
with frightened exclamations from a woman.</p>

<p>The occupants of the cavern started to their feet,
just as a beautiful girl, dressed in a quaint but
charming costume, ran into the doorway in such
haste that she dashed plump up against the Professor,
who caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>For a moment she was startled at seeing two
strangers in a place where she had thought to encounter
none but the Hermit; but her dread of her
pursuer overcame her diffidence, and, clinging to
the Professor, she <span class="locked">exclaimed,—</span></p>

<p>“Oh, save me! save me!”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will,” said the Professor, soothingly,
as his arm tightened its clasp about her waist.
“What’s the matter? Don’t be afraid, my child.
Who is pursuing you?”</p>

<p>The Professor was not displeased at the situation
in which he found himself. The damsel was fair
to see, and the head which rested, in what seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
to him sweet confidence, upon his shoulder, was
crowned with golden hair of matchless beauty.
Even amid the intense excitement of the moment
the reflection flashed through the Professor’s mind
that he was a widower, and that Matilda had
always expressed a willingness to try to love a
stepmother.</p>

<p>“My father! The Baron! He threatens to
kill me,” sobbed the maiden, and then, tearing herself
away from the Professor in a manner which
struck him as being, to say the least, inconsiderate,
she flew to Father Anselm and said, “You, holy
father, will save me.”</p>

<p>“I will try, my daughter; I will try,” replied the
Hermit. And then, turning to the Professor he
said, “It is Ysolt.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Professor, “the Baron’s daughter.
May I ask you, miss, what the old gentleman
is so excited about? It is not one of the customs
here for indignant parents to chase their children
around the country, is it?”</p>

<p>“I had gone from the castle,” said the damsel,
partly to the Hermit and partly to Professor Baffin,
“to meet Sir Bleoberis at the trysting-place.
My father was watching me, and as I neared the
spot he rushed toward me with a drawn sword,
threatening to kill me.”</p>

<p>“It is an outrageous shame!” exclaimed the
Professor, sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
“I eluded him,” continued the sobbing girl, “and
flew towards this place. When he saw me at last
he gave chase. I am afraid he will slay me when
he comes.”</p>

<p>“I think, perhaps, I may be able to reason with
this person when he arrives,” said the Professor,
rubbing his chin and looking at the hermit over the
top of his spectacles. “The Baron ought to be
ashamed of himself to go on in this manner! Tilly,
wipe the poor creature’s eyes with your handkerchief.
There now, dear, cheer up.”</p>

<p>Just then the Baron rushed into the cell, with
his eyes flaming, and his breath coming short and
fast.</p>

<p>He was a large man, with a handsome face, thick
covered with beard. He was dressed in doublet,
trunks and hose, and over one shoulder a mantle
hung gracefully. His sword was in its sheath, and
it was manifest that he had repented of his murderous
purpose.</p>

<p>“Where is that faithless girl?” he demanded in
a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>Ysolt had hidden behind Matilda Baffin.</p>

<p>“Say, priest, where have you secreted her?”</p>

<p>“One moment!” said the Professor, stepping
forward. “May I, without appearing impertinent,
offer a suggestion?”</p>

<p>“Out, varlet!” exclaimed the Baron, pushing
him aside. “Tell me, Hermit, where is Ysolt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
The Professor was actually pale with indignation.
Pushing himself in front of the Baron, and
brandishing his umbrella in a determined way he
said:</p>

<p>“Old man, I want you to understand that you
have to deal with a free and independent American
citizen! What do you mean by ‘varlet?’ I hurl
the opprobrious word back into your teeth, sir! I
am not going to put up with such conduct, I’d like
you to know!”</p>

<p>The Baron for the first time perceived what
manner of man the Professor was, and he paused
for a moment amid his rage to eye the stranger
with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to hurt the young woman?
Is this any way for an affectionate father to behave
to his own offspring? Allow me to say, sir, that
I’ll be hanged if I think it is! If you don’t want
her to marry Sir What’s-his-name, don’t let her;
but it strikes me that charging around the country
after her, and threatening to kill her, is an evidence
that you don’t understand the first principles of
domestic discipline!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Who are you? What
are you doing here?” demanded the Baron, fiercely,
recovering his self-possession.</p>

<p>“I am Professor E. L. Baffin, of Wingohocking
University; and I mean to try to persuade you to
treat your daughter more gently,” said the Professor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
cooling as he remembered that the Baron had
a father’s authority.</p>

<p>“You have a weapon. I will fight you,” said the
Baron, drawing his sword.</p>

<p>The Professor put his cigar in his mouth, and
opened his umbrella suddenly in the Baron’s
face.</p>

<p>The Baron retreated a distance of twenty feet
and looked scared.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the Professor, closing his umbrella
and smiling, “I am not a fighting man. We will
not quarrel. Let us talk the matter over calmly.”</p>

<p>But the Baron, mortified because of the alarm
that he had manifested, rushed savagely at the
Professor, and would have felled him to the earth
had not Matilda sprung forward and placed herself,
shrieking, between the Baron and her father.</p>

<p>At this precise juncture, also, a young man
entered the cell, and, seeing the Baron apparently
about to strike a woman, seized his sword-arm and
held it. The Baron turned sharply about. Recognizing
the youth as his son, he simply looked at
him angrily, and then, while Miss Baffin clung to
the Professor, the Baron seized Ysolt by the arm
and led her weeping away.</p>

<p>The Professor, after freeing himself from Miss
Baffin’s embrace, extended his hand to the youth,
and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“I have not the honor of knowing you, sir, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
you have behaved handsomely. Permit me to inquire
your name?”</p>

<p>“Sir Dinadan; the son of the Baron,” said the
youth, taking hold of the Professor’s hand, as if he
were somewhat uncertain what he had better do
with it.</p>

<p>“No last name?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“That is all. And you are?—”</p>

<p>“I am Everett L. Baffin, a Professor in the
Wingohocking University. I was cast ashore
down here with my daughter. Tilly, let me introduce
to you Sir Dinadan.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan colored, and dropping upon his
knee he seized Miss Baffin’s hand and kissed it.
Rising, he said:</p>

<p>“What, Sir Baffin, is the name of the sweet
lady?”</p>

<p>“Matilda.”</p>

<p>“How lovely!” exclaimed Sir Dinadan.</p>

<p>“It is abbreviated sometimes to Tilly, by her
friends.”</p>

<p>“It is too beautiful,” said the youth, gazing at
Miss Baffin with unconcealed admiration. “I
trust, Sir Baffin, I may be able to serve in some
manner you and the Lady Tilly.”</p>

<p>“Professor Baffin, my dear sir; not Sir Baffin.
Permit me to offer you my card.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan took the card, and seemed perplexed
as to its meaning. He turned it over and
over in a despairing sort of way in his fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
“If you will read it,” said the Professor, “you
will find my name upon it.”</p>

<p>“But, Sir Baffin, I cannot read.”</p>

<p>“Can’t read!” exclaimed the Professor, in
amazement. “You don’t mean to say that you
have never learned to read!”</p>

<p>“High-born people,” replied Sir Dinadan, with
an air of indifference, “care nothing for learning.
We leave that to the monks.”</p>

<p>“This,” said the Professor to Miss Baffin, “is
one of the most extraordinary circumstances that
has yet come under my observation. Tilly, mention
in your journal that the members of the upper
classes are wholly illiterate.”</p>

<p>“As the Lady Tilly is a stranger here,” said Sir
Dinadan, “I would be glad to have her walk with
me to the brow of the hill. I will show her our
beautiful park.”</p>

<p>“That would be splendid!” said Miss Baffin.
“May I go, pa?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said the Professor, with
hesitation, and looking inquiringly at the Hermit.
As that individual appeared to regard the proposition
with no such feeling of alarm as would indicate
a breach of ordinary social custom, the Professor
continued, “Yes, dear, but be sure not to go
beyond ear-shot.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan, smiling, led Miss Baffin away, and
the Professor sat down to finish his cigar and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
have some further conversation with the Hermit.
Before he had time to begin, two other visitors arrived.
Both were young men, gaily dressed in
rich costume. One of them, whom the recluse
greeted as Sir Bleoberis, had a tall slender figure
and an exceedingly handsome countenance, which
was adorned with a moustache and pointed beard.
His companion, Sir Agravaine, was smaller, less
comely, and if his face was an index of his mind, by
no means so intelligent.</p>

<p>After being presented to the Professor, whom
they regarded with not a little curiosity, Sir Bleoberis
said:</p>

<p>“Holy father, the fair Ysolt was here and was
taken away by the Baron, was she not?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the Knight, “I see no hope.
Whilst I am poor, the Baron will never relent.”</p>

<p>“Never!” chimed in Sir Agravaine.</p>

<p>“Is your poverty the only objection he has to
you?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the Professor, “I can understand
a father’s feelings in such a case. It seems hard
upon a young man, but naturally he wants his
daughter to be comfortable. Is there nothing you
can turn your hand to to improve your fortunes?”</p>

<p>“We might rob somebody,” said Sir Agravaine,
with a reflective air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
“Rob somebody!” exclaimed the Professor,
“That is simply atrocious! Can’t you go to work;
go into business, start a factory, speculate in
stocks, or something of that kind?”</p>

<p>“Persons of my degree never work,” said Sir
Bleoberis.</p>

<p>The Professor sighed, “Ah! I forgot. We must
think of something else. Let me see; young man,
I think I can help you a little, perhaps. You agree
to accept some information from me and I believe
I can make your fortune.”</p>

<p>“Do you propose,” asked Sir Agravaine, “to drug
the Baron, or to enchant him so that he will change
his mind? I have often tried love-philters with ladies
whose hands I sought, but they always failed.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the Professor. “I don’t
operate with such trumpery as that. You agree to
help me, and we’ll give this island such a stirring
up as will revolutionize it.”</p>

<p>The Professor then proceeded to explain in detail
the nature and operation of some of the scientific
apparatus which he had with him in his trunk;
and the Knight and the Hermit listened with
open-eyed amazement while he told them of the
telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the photograph,
and other modern inventions.</p>

<p>Whilst the Professor waxed eloquent, Sir Dinadan
and Miss Baffin strolled slowly back towards
the cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Sir Dinadan had improved the opportunity to
offer Miss Baffin his hand, rather abruptly.</p>

<p>“But you can try to love me,” he pleaded, as
she, with much embarrassment but with gentleness,
resisted his importunity.</p>

<p>“I can try, Sir Dinadan,” she said, blushing,
“but really I have known you only a few moments.
It is impossible for me now to have any affection
for you.”</p>

<p>“Will to-morrow be time enough?”</p>

<p>“No, no! I must have a much longer time than
that.”</p>

<p>“I will fight for you. We will get up a tournament
and you will see how I can unhorse the
bravest knights. If I knock over ten, will that
make any difference in your feelings?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest!”</p>

<p>“Fifteen?”</p>

<p>“You do not understand. It is not the custom
in our country to press a suit upon a lady by poking
people off of a horse.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought to fight your father? Will
Sir Baffin break a lance with me to decide if I shall
have you?”</p>

<p>“My father does not fight.”</p>

<p>“Does not fight! Certainly you don’t mean
that?”</p>

<p>“He is the Vice-President of the Universal
Peace Society.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
“The WHAT?” asked Sir Dinadan, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Of the Peace Society; a society which opposes
fighting of every kind, under any circumstances.”</p>

<p>It was a moment or two before Sir Dinadan
could get his breath. Then he <span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“But—but then, Lady Tilly, what—what do
men in your country do with themselves?”</p>

<p>Miss Baffin laughed and endeavored to explain
to him the modern methods of existence.</p>

<p>“I never could have believed such a thing from
other lips,” said Sir Dinadan. “It is marvellous.
But tell me, how do lovers woo in your land?”</p>

<p>“Really, Sir Dinadan,” replied Miss Baffin,
blushing, “I have had no experience worth speaking
of in such matters. I suppose, perhaps, they
show a lady that they love her, and then wait until
she can make up her mind.”</p>

<p>“I will wait, then, as long as you wish.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Miss Baffin, shyly, although plainly
she was beginning to feel a genuine interest in
the proceeding, “your father and your mother may
not think as you do; and then, I shall not want to
stay upon this island if I can get away.”</p>

<p>“My mother always consents to anything I
wish, and the Baron never dares to oppose what
she wants. And if you go back to your own country,
I will go with you, whether you accept me or
not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Miss Baffin smiled. Sir Dinadan was in earnest,
at any rate. She could not help thinking of the
sensation that would be created in Wingohocking
if she should walk up the fashionable street of the
town some afternoon with Sir Dinadan in his parti-colored
dress of doublet and stockings, and jaunty
feathered cap, and sword, while his long yellow
hair dangled about his shoulders.</p>

<p>While Sir Dinadan was protesting that he should
love her for ever and for ever, they came back
again to the Hermit’s cell, and then Sir Dinadan,
greeting Sir Bleoberis and Sir Agravaine, presented
Miss Baffin to them.</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis was courteous but somewhat indifferent;
Sir Agravaine, upon the contrary, appeared
to be deeply impressed with Miss Baffin’s
beauty. After gazing at her steadily for a few
moments, he approached her, and while the other
members of the company engaged in conversation,
he <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Fair lady, you are not married?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Miss Baffin, with some indignation.</p>

<p>“Permit me, then, to offer you my hand.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Miss Baffin, becoming
angry.</p>

<p>“I love you. Will you be mine?” said Sir Agravaine,
falling upon one knee and trying to take her
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Miss Baffin boxed his ear with a degree of violence.</p>

<p>Rising with a rueful countenance, he <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Am I to understand, then, that you decline the
offer?”</p>

<p>Miss Baffin, without replying, walked away from
him and joined her father.</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan was asking the Hermit for a few
simples with which to relieve the suffering of his
noble mother.</p>

<p>“I judge, from what you say,” remarked the
Professor, “that the Baroness is afflicted with
lumbago. The Hermit’s remedies, I fear, will
be ineffectual. Permit me to recommend you
to iron her noble back, and to apply a porous
plaster.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan wished to have the process more
clearly explained. The Professor unfolded the
matter in detail, and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“I have some plasters in my trunk, down there
upon the beach.”</p>

<p>“Then you are a leech?” asked Sir Dinadan.</p>

<p>“Matilda, my child,” remarked the Professor,
“observe that word ‘leech’ used by Sir Dinadan!
How very interesting it is! Not exactly a leech,
Sir Dinadan; but it is my habit to try to know a
little of everything.”</p>

<p>“Can you cast a lover’s horoscope?” asked Sir
Agravaine, looking at Matilda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
“Young man,” said the Professor, sternly, “there
is no such foolery as a horoscope; and as for love,
you had better let it alone until you have more wit
and a heavier purse.”</p>

<p>“I wish you and the Lady Tilly to come with me
to the castle,” remarked Sir Dinadan. “My father
will welcome you heartily if you can medicine the
sickness of my mother; and she will be eager to
receive your fair daughter.”</p>

<p>“I will go, of course,” replied the Professor;
“you are very kind. Tilly, we had better accept, I
think?”</p>

<p>Miss Baffin was willing to leave the matter
wholly in the hands of her father.</p>

<p>After requesting Sir Dinadan to have his luggage
brought up from the beach, the Professor
bade adieu to the Hermit, and then turning to Sir
Bleoberis, who stood with a disconsolate air by the
fire, he said:</p>

<p>“I will see you again about your affair; and
meantime you may depend upon my using my influence
with the Baron to remove his prejudices.
I will dance at your wedding yet; that is, figuratively
speaking, of course; for, as a precise matter
of fact, I do not know how to dance.”</p>

<p>As the Professor and Sir Dinadan and Miss
Baffin left the cell, Sir Agravaine approached the
lady and whispered:</p>

<p>“Did I understand you to say you don’t love me?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Miss Baffin twitched the skirt of her gown to one
side in a scornful way, and passed on without replying.</p>

<p>“Women,” sighed Sir Agravaine, as he looked
mournfully after her, “are <em>so</em> incomprehensible. I
wish I knew what she meant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE CASTLE OF BARON BORS.</span></h3>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_047.png" width="66" height="68" alt="A" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">As</span> Sir Dinadan led the Professor and Miss
Baffin along the lovely path which went
winding through the woods toward the
castle, the Professor lighted another cigar, and
in response to Sir Dinadan, he entered upon an
explanation of the nature of tobacco, the methods
and extent of its use, and its effect upon the human
system.</p>

<p>“The Lady Tilly, of course she smokes sometimes,
also?” asked Sir Dinadan.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied Miss Baffin, “ladies in my
country never do.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” added the Professor.</p>

<p>“And yet, if it is so pleasing and so beneficial as
you say,” responded the youth, “why should not
ladies attempt it?”</p>

<p>The Professor really could not say; Sir Dinadan
was pressing him almost too closely. He compromised
further discussion by yielding promptly, although
with a melancholy reflection that his store<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of cigars was small, to a request to teach Sir Dinadan,
at the earliest opportunity, to smoke.</p>

<p>As they neared the castle, the Professor’s attention
was absorbed in observing the details of the
structure. It was a massive edifice of stone, having
severe outlines and no ornamentation worthy of the
name, but presenting, from the very grandeur of its
proportions, an impressive and not unpleasing appearance.
It was surrounded by a wide fosse filled
with water; and the Professor was delighted to observe,
as they drew near, that the entrance was
protected with a portcullis and a drawbridge. The
bridge was drawn up, and the iron portcullis, made
of bars of huge size, was closed.</p>

<p>“Magnificent, isn’t it, Tilly?” exclaimed the
Professor, gleefully. “It is probably the most perfect
specimen of early English architecture now
upon earth. Most fortunately I have in my trunks
a photographic apparatus with which to obtain a
picture of it.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan seized a curved horn which hung
upon the branch of a tree, and blew a blast loud
and long upon it.</p>

<p>The Professor regarded the performance with intense
interest and not a little enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The warder of the castle appeared at the grating,
and, perceiving Sir Dinadan, saluted him;
then lowering the drawbridge and lifting the portcullis,
which ascended with many hideous creaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
and groans from the rusty iron, Sir Dinadan and
his companions entered.</p>

<p>Leaving the Professor and Miss Baffin comfortably
seated in a great hall, the walls of which were
adorned with curious tapestries dark with age, with
swords and axes and trophies of the chase, Sir Dinadan
went in search of the Baron.</p>

<p>“Little did we think, Tilly,” said the Professor,
looking around, “when we left New York four
weeks ago—it seems more like four years—that
we should find ourselves, within a month, in such a
place as this.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe it yet,” responded Miss
Baffin.</p>

<p>“It does seem like a dream. And yet we are
certainly wide awake, and we are in the hall of a
real castle, waiting for real people to come to us.”</p>

<p>“Sir Dinadan seems very real, too,” said Miss
Baffin, timidly.</p>

<p>“Very! There can be no doubt about it.”</p>

<p>“And he behaves like a real young man, too,”
continued Miss Baffin. “He proposed to me this
morning.”</p>

<p>“What! Proposed to you! Incredible! Why, the
boy has not known you more than an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“He is a man, pa; not a boy,” said Miss Baffin,
a little hurt. “It <em>was</em> rather sudden; but, then,
genuine affection sometimes manifests itself in that
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
The Professor smiled; he perceived the exact
situation of things. Then he looked very serious
again. This was a contingency of which he had
not taken account.</p>

<p>“Well, Tilly,” he said, “I hardly know what to
say about the matter. It is so completely unexpected.
You didn’t accept him?”</p>

<p>“No; not exactly, but—”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. We will leave the situation as
it is for the present. When we have been here
longer we can better determine what we should
do.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan entered with the Baron. The Baron
greeted his guests with warmth, making no allusion
to the occurrences in the Hermit’s cell, and
appearing, indeed, to have forgotten them.</p>

<p>“It is enough, sir, and fair damsel, that misfortune
has thrown you upon our shores. You shall make
this your home while you live.”</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks,” responded the Professor.</p>

<p>“I cherish the belief that I can be of service to
you. By the way, may I ask how is the noble
Lady Bors?”</p>

<p>“Suffering greatly. My son tells me you are a
wise leech, and can give her release from her
pain.”</p>

<p>“I hope I can. If you will permit my daughter,
here, to see the lady and to follow my directions,
we may be able to help her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
“There,” said the Baron, waving his hand, “are
your apartments. When you have made ready we
will summon you to our banquet.”</p>

<p>“Your property, which was upon the beach, will
be placed before you very soon,” said Sir Dinadan.</p>

<p>The Professor and Miss Baffin entered the
rooms, and the Baron withdrew with his son.</p>

<p>When the trunks came and were opened, the
guests arrayed themselves in their finest costumes,
and Miss Baffin contrived to give to her beauty a
bewildering effect by an artistic arrangement of
frippery, which received its consummation when
she placed some lovely artificial flowers in her
hair.</p>

<p>Then the Professor, giving her certain plasters and
a soothing drug or two, requested a servant, who
stood outside the door, to announce to Lady Bors
that Miss Baffin was ready to give her treatment.</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan came forward and gallantly escorted
Miss Baffin to his mother’s room; where, after presenting
her, he left her and returned to the Professor.</p>

<p>The young man led the Professor about the
castle, showing him its apartments, its furniture
and decorations, with an earnest purpose to try to
find favor in the eyes of the father of the woman
he loved. The Professor, for his part, was charmed
with his companion, and his interest in the castle
and its appurtenances increased every moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
“This,” said Sir Dinadan, pausing before a large
oaken door, barred with iron, “is the portal to the
upper room of the south tower. In this chamber
the Baron has confined Ysolt, my sister, until she
consents to think no more of Sir Bleoberis.”</p>

<p>“Locked her up, has he? That seems hard.”</p>

<p>“Cruel, is it not?”</p>

<p>“You favor the suit of the Knight, do you?”
inquired the Professor.</p>

<p>“I would let Ysolt choose for herself. He is a
worthy man; but he has poverty.”</p>

<p>“We must try to help him,” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“You would act differently in such a case; would
you not?” asked Sir Dinadan, rather eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course; that is, I mean,” said the
Professor, suddenly recollecting himself, and what
Miss Baffin had told him, “I mean, I would think
about it. I would give the matter thoughtful consideration.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan sighed, and asked the Professor if
he would come with him to the dining-hall.</p>

<p>It was a noble room. As the Professor entered
it with Sir Dinadan, as he looked at the vast fireplace
filled with burning logs, because the air of the
castle was chilly even in summer time, at the
rudely carved beams that traversed the ceiling, at
the quaint curtains and curious ornaments upon
the walls, at the long table which stretched across
the floor and bore upon its polished surface a multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
of vessels of strange and often fantastic
shapes, he could hardly believe his senses. These
things, this method of existence, he had read about
myriads of times, but they had never seemed very
real to him until he encountered them here face to
face.</p>

<p>These people among whom he had come by such
strange mischance actually lived and moved here,
amid these scenes, and they were as common and
as prosy to them as the scenes in his own home in
the little enclosure hard by the walls of the university
building at Wingohocking.</p>

<p>It was that home and its equipment that seemed
strange and incongruous to him now. As he
thought about it, he felt that he would experience
an actual nervous shock if he should suddenly be
plumped down in his own library. Very oddly, as
his mind reverted to the subject, his memory recalled
with peculiarly vivid distinctness an old and
faded dressing-gown in which he used to come to
breakfast; and a blue cream-jug with a broken
handle, which used to be placed before him at the
meal.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the dressing-gown and the
defective jug were as far back in the misty past as
such a social condition as that with which he had
now been brought into contact would have seemed
if he had thought of it a month ago.</p>

<p>As the servants entered, bearing the viands upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
large dishes, the Baron made his appearance at the
upper end of the room, and a moment later Lady
Bors walked slowly in, leaning upon the arm of
Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“Your sweet daughter,” she said, when the Professor
had been presented to her, “has eased my
pain already. I think she must be an angel sent
to me by Heaven.”</p>

<p>“She <em>is</em> an angel,” said Sir Dinadan, emphatically,
so that his mother looked at him curiously.
Miss Baffin blushed.</p>

<p>“Angels, my lady, do not come with porous
plasters,” said the Professor, smiling.</p>

<p>“I love her already, whether she is angel or
woman,” replied Lady Bors, patting Miss Baffin’s
arm.</p>

<p>“So do—,” Sir Dinadan did not complete the
sentence. It occurred to him that he might perhaps
be getting a little too demonstrative.</p>

<p>“The Lady Tilly,” said the Baroness, “has told
me something of the adventure which brought you
here. Will you be so courteous as to tell us more,
and to inform us of that strange and wonderful
land from which you have come?”</p>

<p>“Willingly, madam,” replied the Professor. And
so, while the meal was in progress, the Professor,—not
neglecting the food, for he was really hungry,—tried,
in the plainest language he could command,
to convey to the minds of his hearers some notion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of the marvels of modern civilization. The Baron,
Lady Bors, and Sir Dinadan asked many questions,
and they more than once expressed the greatest
astonishment at the revelations made in the Professor’s
narrative.</p>

<p>“I will show you some of these wonders,” said
Professor Baffin. “Most happily I have with me
in my trunks quite a number of instruments, such
as those I have told you of.”</p>

<p>“In your trunks!” exclaimed the Baron. “You
do not wear trunks, as we do.”</p>

<p>The Professor at once explained the misapprehension.
When he had done, there was heard in
the room the twanging of the strings of a rude
musical instrument.</p>

<p>“It is the minstrel,” said Sir Dinadan, as the
Professor and Miss Baffin looked around.</p>

<p>The Professor was delighted.</p>

<p>“He is going to sing,” said the Baron.</p>

<p>The bard, after a few preliminary thrums upon
an imbecile harp, burst into song. He occupied
several moments in reciting a ballad of chivalry,
and although his manner was dramatic, his voice
was sadly cracked and out of tune.</p>

<p>“Tilly,” said the Professor, “remember to note
in your journal that the musical system here is
constructed from a defective minor scale, with incorrect
intervals. I observed precisely the same
characteristics in the song that our Irish nurse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Mary, used to put you to sleep with when you
were a baby. I stood outside the chamber door
one night, and wrote the strain down as she sang
it. This proves that it is very ancient.”</p>

<p>“You like the song, then?” asked the Baron.</p>

<p>“It is very interesting, indeed—very!” replied
the Professor. “I think we shall obtain a great
deal of valuable information here. No, Tilly, you
had better refuse it,” said the Professor, observing
that Sir Dinadan, who appeared to be animated by
a resolute purpose to stuff Miss Baffin, was pressing
another dish upon her, “you will spoil your
night’s rest.”</p>

<p>“Do you sing, Sir Baffin?” inquired Lady Bors.</p>

<p>“Never in company, my lady,” replied the Professor;
“my vocalization would excite too much
alarm.”</p>

<p>The Baron and his wife manifestly did not comprehend
the pleasantry.</p>

<p>“My daughter sings very nicely; but you can
hear her sing without her lips being opened. Excuse
me for a moment.”</p>

<p>The Professor went to his apartment, and presently
returned, bringing with him a phonograph.
Placing it upon the table, he turned the crank.
From the funnel at once issued a lovely soprano
voice, singing, with exquisite enunciation and inflection,
a song, every word of which was heard by
the listeners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Lady Bors looked scared, Sir Dinadan crossed
himself, the Baron eyed the Professor doubtfully,
the minstrel over in the corner laid down his harp,
and relieved his overcharged feelings by bursting
into tears, which he wiped away with the sleeve of
his tunic.</p>

<p>“It must be magic,” said the Baron, at last; “no
mere man could hide an angelic spirit in such a
place, and compel it to sing.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to explain,” said the Professor; and
then he unfolded the mechanism, and showed the
method of its operation. “My daughter sang up
several songs for me before we left home. They
were stored away here for future use. Tilly, my
love, sing something, so that our friends can perceive
that it is the same voice.”</p>

<p>Miss Baffin, after some hesitation, began “The
Last Rose of Summer.” While she sang, Sir Dinadan
looked at her with rapture depicted on his
countenance. When she had done he reflected for
an instant, and then, rising and walking over to the
place where the minstrel sat, he seized by the ear
that unfortunate operator with defective minor
scales, and, leading him to the door, he kicked him
into the hall.</p>

<p>This appeared to relieve Sir Dinadan’s feelings.</p>

<p>When he returned, the Professor persuaded him
to have his voice recorded by the phonograph;
and by the time the Baron and Lady Bors had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
also tried the experiment, the faith of the family
in the powers of Professor Baffin had risen to
such a pitch that the Baron would have been almost
ready to lay wagers in favor of his omnipotence.</p>

<p>The Professor that evening accepted for himself
and his daughter a very urgent invitation to make
the castle their home, at least until Fate and the
future should determine if they were to remain permanently
upon the island. The chance that they
would ever escape seemed indeed, exceedingly
slender; and the Professor resolved to accept
the promise with philosophical resignation.</p>

<p>He employed much of his time during the first
weeks that he was the Baron’s guest in making the
Baron familiar with some of the wonders of modern
discovery and invention. The Baron also was deeply
interested in an exhibition given by the Professor
of the powers of his patent india-rubber life-raft,
which the Professor brought up from the beach
folded into a small bundle. After inflating it, to
the amazement of the spectators, he put it into the
fosse that surrounded the castle and paddled about
upon it. The raft was allowed to remain in the
ditch ready for use.</p>

<p>The Professor often went outside the castle walls
to talk with Sir Bleoberis, and to comfort him.
The Professor explained the telegraph and the locomotive
to the Knight; and when the Knight assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
him that the armorers of the island could
make the machinery that would be required, if they
should receive suitable instructions, the Professor
arranged to build a short railroad line and a telegraph
line in partnership with Sir Bleoberis, if the
latter would obtain the necessary concession from
King Brandegore. Professor Baffin was of the
opinion that the Knight, by such means, might
ultimately acquire great wealth.</p>

<p>Meantime Sir Dagonet had been seen several
times of late in the vicinity of the castle, and once
he had made again a formal demand upon the Baron
for Ysolt’s hand. This the Baron refused, whereupon
Sir Dagonet returned an insolent reply that
he would have her in spite of her father’s objection.
The Professor sincerely pitied both Ysolt and Sir
Bleoberis, but as the Baron always became violently
angry when the suffering of the lovers was alluded
to, the Professor disliked to plead their cause.</p>

<p>It occurred to him, however, one day that there
could be no possible harm in arranging to permit
the forlorn creatures to converse with each other;
and so, with the help of Miss Baffin, who was allowed
to enter the captive’s room, he fixed up a
telephone, the machinery of which he had in one
of his trunks, with a wire running from Ysolt’s
window to a point some distance beyond the castle
wall.</p>

<p>The battery with which the instruments were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
supplied was placed in an iron box furnished by
Sir Bleoberis, and hidden behind a huge oak tree.</p>

<p>The lovers were delighted with the telephone and
its performances; but the Professor’s ingenious
kindness caused him a great deal of serious trouble.</p>

<p>It seems that Miss Baffin one morning had been
showing her father’s umbrella to Ysolt, and making
her acquainted with its peculiarities and uses.</p>

<p>When Miss Baffin had withdrawn, Sir Bleoberis
began to breathe through the telephone protestations
of his undying love, and finally he appealed
to Ysolt to fly with him. Of course he expected
nothing to come of this appeal, for he had not the
slightest conception of any method by which Ysolt
could escape from her prison. He merely threw it
in, in a general sort of a way, as an expression of
the intensity of his affection.</p>

<p>But it suggested to the mind of Ysolt an ingenious
thought; and she responded through the telephone
that if Sir Bleoberis would keep out of sight
and have his gallant steed ready, she would join
him in a few moments. The Knight’s heart beat
so fiercely at this news that it fairly made his armor
vibrate.</p>

<p>Obeying the orders of Ysolt, he went behind the
oak and sat upon the iron box containing the Professor’s
battery and electrical apparatus.</p>

<p>Ysolt’s window was but twenty feet from the surface
of the water in the fosse. Directly beneath it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
by a most fortunate chance, floated the life-raft of
Professor Baffin. The brave girl, climbing upon
the stone sill of the window, hoisted the umbrella,
and sailing swiftly downward through the air, she
alighted safely upon the raft. A single push upon
the wall sent it to the further side of the ditch,
whereupon Ysolt leaped ashore, unperceived by the
warder or by any one in the castle.</p>

<p>A moment more, and seated upon the steed of
her cavalier, with his strong arm around her, she
would be flying to peace and happiness and love’s
sweet fulfilment, far, far beyond the reach of the
angry Baron’s power.</p>

<p>But, alas, human life is so full of mischances!
As Ysolt neared the great oak behind which her
lover sat, Sir Dagonet came riding carelessly across
the lawn. Seeing her he spurred his horse forward,
and, right before the eyes of Sir Bleoberis,
he grasped her by the arm, tossed her to his saddle
and dashed away across the country.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Why Sir Bleoberis did not Leap to the Rescue.</span></div></div>

<p>But why did not Sir Bleoberis leap to the rescue?</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis tried with all his might to do so;
but he had on a full suit of steel armor, and the
Professor’s battery, by some means even yet unexplained,
so charged the cover of the box with magnetism
that it held the Knight close down. He
could not move a muscle of his legs. He writhed
and twisted and expressed his fury in language that
was vehement and scandalous; but the Professor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
infamous machine held him fast; and he was compelled
to sit by, imbecile and raging, while the
wind bore to his ears the heart-rending screams of
his sweetheart as she cried to him to come and
save her from an awful fate.</p>

<p>The shrieks of the unhappy Ysolt penetrated to
the castle, and at once the Baron ran out, followed
by Sir Dinadan, Professor Baffin, and a host of the
Baron’s retainers, all of them armed and ready for
war. The first act of the Professor was to capture
his expanded umbrella, which was being blown
about wildly by the wind. Furling it, he proceeded
to the place where Sir Bleoberis sat, trying
to explain to the infuriated Baron what had happened.</p>

<p>“There!” said Sir Bleoberis, savagely, pointing
to the Professor, “is the vile wretch that did it all!
Seize him! He, he alone is to blame.”</p>

<p>The Professor was amazed.</p>

<p>“Yes!” exclaimed Sir Bleoberis, “it was he who
persuaded the fair Ysolt to leap from the window;
it was he who notified Sir Dagonet, and it is his
wicked enchantment that held me here so that I
could not fly to her succor. I cannot even get up
now.”</p>

<p>“The man,” said the Professor to the Baron,
“appears to be suffering from intellectual aberration.
I can’t imagine what he means. Why don’t
you rise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
“You, foul wizard, know that I am held here by
your infernal power!”</p>

<p>“Try to be calm,” said the Professor, soothingly.
“Your expressions are too strong. Let me see—.
Why, bless my soul, the electrical current has magnetized
the box. There, now,” said the Professor
as he snipped a couple of the wires, “try it again.”</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis arose without effort. Baron Bors
stepped forward and said sternly:</p>

<p>“What, you, Sir Bleoberis, were doing here I
do not know. I suspect you of evil purposes. But
it is clear you had nothing to do with the seizure of
my daughter, if, indeed, she has been carried off
by Sir Dagonet. You may go. But as for you,”
shouted the Baron, turning to the Professor, “I
perceive that your devilish arts have been used
against me and my family while you have been
eating my bread. The world shall no longer be
burdened by such a monster. Away with him to
the scaffold!”</p>

<p>“This,” said the Professor, as the perspiration
stood in beads upon his pallid face, “is painful;
very painful. Allow me to explain. The fact is
I—”</p>

<p>“Away!” said the Baron, with an impatient gesture.
“Off with his head as quickly as possible!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir,” contended the Professor, as
the Baron’s retainers seized him, “this is simply
awful! No court, no jury, no trial, no chance to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
my story! It is not just. It is not fair play. Permit
me, for one moment, to—”</p>

<p>“To the block with him!” screamed the Baron.
“Have no more parley about it!”</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis came forward.</p>

<p>“Sir Bors,” he said, “this, in a measure, is my
quarrel. It falls to me by right to punish this
wretch. Will you permit me?” and then Sir
Bleoberis struck the Professor in the face with his
mailed gauntlet.</p>

<p>Professor Baffin would have assailed him upon
the spot, but for the fact that he was a captive.</p>

<p>“He means that you shall fight him,” said Sir
Dinadan, who retained his faith in the Professor,
remembering his own affection for Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“Certainly I will,” said the Professor. “Where,
and when, and how? I would like to have it out
right here on the spot.”</p>

<p>It is melancholy to think what would have been
the sorrow of the members of the Universal Peace
Society, of which the Professor was the first vice-president,
if they could have observed the eagerness
with which that good man seemed to long for
the fray, and the fiery rage which beamed from
his eyes until the sparks almost appeared to fly
from his spectacles.</p>

<p>Miss Baffin at this moment rushed upon the
scene, and in wild affright flung her arms about her
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
“The contest shall be made,” said the Baron,
sternly. “Unhand him!”</p>

<p>The Professor hurriedly explained the matter to
Matilda, who sobbed piteously.</p>

<p>“You shall have my armor, my horse, and my
lance,” said Sir Dinadan in a kindly voice to the
Professor. “Go and get them,” he continued,
speaking to some of the servants.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Professor. “I am much
obliged. You are a fine young man.”</p>

<p>“But, pa,” said Miss Baffin through her tears,
“surely you are not going to fight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love.”</p>

<p>“And you a member of the Peace Society, too.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, my child. You may omit to
note this extraordinary occurrence in your journal.
The Society may as well remain in ignorance of
it. But I must conform to the customs of the
place.”</p>

<p>“How can you ever do anything upon a horse,
with armor and a lance? It is dreadful!”</p>

<p>“No, my child, it may perhaps be regarded as
fortunate. For many years I have longed to observe
the practices of ancient chivalry more closely;
that opportunity has now come. I am about to
have actual practical experience with them.”</p>

<p>Miss Baffin wiped her eyes as Sir Dinadan came
to her side and tried to comfort her. Sir Agravaine,
who had ridden up during the excitement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
dismounted when he saw Miss Baffin, and pulling
Sir Dinadan by the sleeve, he whispered:</p>

<p>“You are acquainted with that lady?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind ascertaining for me if I am to
understand her remarkable conduct to me as tantamount
to a refusal? I don’t want to trouble you,
but—”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan turned abruptly away, leaving Sir
Agravaine still involved in doubt.</p>

<p>When the armor came, Sir Dinadan helped the
Professor to put it on. It was a size or two too
large for him, and the Professor had a considerable
amount of difficulty in adjusting the pieces properly,
but, with the help of Sir Dinadan, he at last
succeeded.</p>

<p>“Bring me my lance!” he exclaimed, with a
firm voice, as he stepped forward.</p>

<p>“It is here,” said Sir Dinadan.</p>

<p>“Farewell, my child,” said the Professor to Miss
Baffin, making a futile attempt to bend his elbows
so that he could embrace her. “Farewell!” and
the Professor tried to kiss her, but he merely succeeded
in injuring her nose with the visor of his
helmet.</p>

<p>“O pa!” said Miss Baffin, weeping, “if you
should be killed.”</p>

<p>“No danger of that love, none at all. I am perfectly
safe. I feel exactly as if I were a cooking-stove,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
to be sure; but you may depend upon my
giving a good account of myself. And now, dear,
adieu! Ho, there!” exclaimed the Professor, with
faint reminiscences of the tragic stage coming into
his mind. “Bring me my steed!”</p>

<p>The determined efforts of four muscular men
were required to mount the Professor upon his
horse. And when he was fairly astride, with his
lance in his hand, he felt as if he weighed at least
three thousand pounds, and the weapon seemed
quite as large as the jib-boom of the “Morning
Star.”</p>

<p>The warrior did his best to sit his horse gracefully;
but the miserable beast pranced and curveted
in such a very unreasonable manner that his
spectacles were continually shaking loose, and in
his efforts to fix them, and at the same time to
hold his horse, he lost control of his lance, and
came near impaling two or three of the spectators.</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan’s own groom then took the bridle-rein,
and leading the horse quietly to the jousting-ground
put him in place directly opposite to Sir
Bleoberis, whose lance was in rest, and who evidently
intended to spit the Professor through and
through at the first encounter.</p>

<p>The Professor really felt uncomfortably at a disadvantage
in his iron-clad condition, and he began
to think that the sports and combats of the olden
time were perhaps not so interesting after all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
when brought within the range of practical experience.</p>

<p>Suddenly the herald’s trumpet sounded a blast.
The Professor had not the least notion of the meaning
of the sound, but Sir Bleoberis started promptly
towards him, and the Professor’s horse, trained at
jousting, also started. The Professor was not quite
ready, and he pulled the rein hard while trying to
fix his lance in its rest. This caused the horse to
swerve sharply around, whereupon the warrior’s
spectacles came off, and the horse dashed at full
speed to the side of the jousting-ground, bringing
the half-blinded Professor’s lance up against a tree,
into which the point stuck fast. The Professor was
hurled with some violence to the ground, and the
horse ran away.</p>

<p>When they picked him up and unlatched his helmet,
he was bleeding at the nose.</p>

<p>“It is of no consequence, Matilda, of no consequence,
I assure you,” he said. “I am shaken up
a little, but not hurt. I think, perhaps, I need
practice at this kind of thing.”</p>

<p>The Professor, while speaking, felt about him in
a bewildered way for the pocket in which he was
used to keep his handkerchief. But as the armor
baffled his efforts to find it, Miss Baffin offered him
her kerchief with which to stanch the blood.</p>

<p>“The ancients, Matilda,” said the Professor, as
he pressed the handkerchief to his nose, “must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
have possessed great physical strength, and they
could not have been near sighted. By the way,
where are my glasses?”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan handed them to him.</p>

<p>“You will not attempt to get on that horrid
horse, again, pa, will you?” said Miss Baffin, entreatingly.</p>

<p>“I think not, my child, unless I am forced to do
so. Jousting is interesting to read about; but as a
matter of fact it is brutal. I think, Sir Dinadan, I
should be more comfortable if I could get this cast-iron
overcoat off, so that I could move my elbows
without creaking.”</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan helped him to remove his armor, and
said:</p>

<p>“My noble mother has insisted that Sir Bleoberis
shall not fight with you, and the Baron has yielded
to her wish.”</p>

<p>“How can I thank you?” exclaimed Miss
Baffin.</p>

<p>Sir Dinadan looked at her as if he would like
to tell her how, if he dared venture. But he only
said:</p>

<p>“I deserve no thanks. My mother is upon your
side and that of your father. She asks me to bring
him to her.”</p>

<p>The Baron was with his wife, and Sir Bleoberis
stood before them.</p>

<p>“Sir Bamn,” said the Baron, “Lady Bors insists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
that you are innocent of any wrong-doing; and Sir
Bleoberis, seeing that you are unskilled, has resolved
not to have a combat with you. I am willing
to pardon you upon one condition: that you
find my daughter and bring her back to me.”</p>

<p>“That I should be willing to try to do under any
circumstances,” said the Professor. “I regret her
loss very deeply. But, you see, I know nothing of
the country. I am afraid I should not discover her
if I should go alone.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you,” said Sir Bleoberis.</p>

<p>“That is first-rate,” said the Professor. “Give
me your hand.”</p>

<p>“We will keep your daughter in the castle as a
hostage,” said the Baron. “When you return with
Ysolt you shall have the Lady Tilly, and Sir Bleoberis
shall have Ysolt.”</p>

<p>“I am profoundly grateful,” replied Sir Bleoberis,
bowing.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the Professor to Miss Baffin,
“does the arrangement suit you?”</p>

<p>“It suits me,” muttered Sir Dinadan.</p>

<p>“I must stay whether I wish to or not,” replied
Miss Baffin. “But I shall worry about you every
moment while you are gone.”</p>

<p>“Sir Dinadan may be able to soothe her,” said
Sir Bleoberis, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I think I could, if I were allowed to try,” insinuated
Sir Agravaine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
“I charge Sir Dinadan and his noble parents
with the task,” said the Professor.</p>

<p>The entire party, with the exception of Sir Agravaine,
then returned to the castle, so that the Professor
could make ready for the journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="subhead">THE RESCUE.</span></h3>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_072.png" width="66" height="68" alt="P" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword in04">Professor Baffin</span> politely declined
to wear the armor of Sir Dinadan upon
the journey. He packed a few things in a
satchel, and putting his revolver in his pocket, he
bade adieu to his daughter and the members of the
Baron’s family. Mounting his horse by the side of
Sir Bleoberis, who rode in full armor, the two
trotted briskly out through the woods to the roadway,
which ran by not far from the castle.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go to look for the lady?”
asked the Professor, as the Knight started down
the road at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>“The villain, no doubt, has carried her captive to
his castle. We shall seek her there.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to get her out? I have had
very little experience, personally, in storming castles.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to devise some plan when we
get there,” replied the Knight. “The castle, unhappily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
is upon an island in the middle of the
lake.”</p>

<p>“And I can’t swim,” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the King will give us help. It is close
to the place where he holds his court.”</p>

<p>The Professor began to think that the case
looked exceedingly unpromising. He lapsed into
silence, thinking over the probable results of the
failure of his mission; and as the Knight appeared
to be absorbed in his own reflections, the pair
rode forward without engaging in further conversation.</p>

<p>Professor Baffin did not fail to notice the extreme
loveliness of the country through which they were
passing. It presented all the characteristics of a
perfect English landscape; but he observed that it
was not fully cultivated, and that the agricultural
methods employed were of a very primitive kind.</p>

<p>After an hour’s ride, the two horsemen entered a
wood. Hardly had they done so before they heard,
near to them, the voice of a woman crying loudly
for help. Sir Bleoberis at once spurred his horse
forward, and the Professor followed close behind him.</p>

<p>Presently they perceived a Knight in armor endeavoring
to hold upon the horse in front of him
a young woman of handsome appearance, who
screamed loudly as she attempted to release herself
from his grasp.</p>

<p>“Drop her!” exclaimed the Professor in an excited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
manner, and drawing his revolver, “put her
down; let her go at once!”</p>

<p>The Knight turned, and seeing the intruders he
released the maiden, and levelling his lance, made
straight for Sir Bleoberis at full gallop.</p>

<p>The lady, white with terror, flew to the Professor,
and reposed her head upon his bosom.</p>

<p>Professor Baffin was embarrassed. He had no
idea what he had better do or say. He could not
repulse the poor creature; and as the situation,
upon the whole, was not positively disagreeable, he
permitted her to remain, sobbing upon his bosom,
while he watched the fight and dried her eyes, in
a fatherly way, with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>The two Knights came together with a terrible
shock which made the sparks fly; but neither was
unhorsed or injured, and the lances of both glanced
aside. They turned, and made at each other
again. This time the lance of each pierced the
armor of the other, so that neither lance could
be withdrawn. It really seemed as if the two
knights would have to undress and to walk off,
leaving their armor pinioned together. A moment
later the strange Knight fell to the ground, and
lay perfectly still. The Professor went up to him
and taking his lance from his hand, so that Sir
Bleoberis could move, unlaced the Knight’s helmet.</p>

<p>He was dead.</p>

<p>The Professor was inexpressibly shocked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
“Why,” he exclaimed, “the man is dead! Most
horrible, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Sir Bleoberis, coolly. “I tried to
kill him.”</p>

<p>“You wanted to murder him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad you did,” exclaimed the damsel
with a sweet smile. “How can I thank you?
And you, my dear preserver.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, madam,” exclaimed the Professor,
“I had nothing to do with it. I consider it
perfectly horrible.”</p>

<p>Turning to Sir Bleoberis, the maiden said, “It
was you who fought, but it was this brave and wise
man who brought you here, was it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sir Bleoberis, smiling.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” exclaimed the lady, flinging her
arms around the Professor’s neck. “I can never
repay you—never, never, excepting with a life of
devotion.”</p>

<p>The Professor began to feel warm. Disengaging
himself as speedily as possible, he <span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“Of course madam, I am very glad you have
been rescued—very. But I deeply regret that the
Knight over there was slain. What,” asked the
Professor of Sir Bleoberis, “will you do with him?”</p>

<p>“Let him lie. He is of no further use.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of anything so shocking,” said
Professor Baffin. “And how are we to dispose of
this lady?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
“I will go with you,” exclaimed the damsel, looking
eagerly at the Professor. “Let me tell you my
story. My name is Bragwaine. I am the daughter
of the Prince Sagramor. That dead Knight
found me, a few hours ago, walking in the park by
my father’s castle. Sir Lamorak, he was called.
Riding up swiftly to me, he seized me, and carried
me away. He brought me, despite my screams
and struggles, to this place, where you found us
both. I should now be a captive in his castle but
for you.”</p>

<p>Bragwaine seemed about to fall upon the Professor’s
neck again, but he pretended to stumble, and
retreated to a safe distance.</p>

<p>“Is there much of this kind of thing going on,—this
business of galloping off with marriageable
girls?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Sir Bleoberis.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said the Professor; “this is the
second case I have encountered to-day. We shall
most likely have quite a collection of rescued damsels
on our hands by the time we get back home.
It is interesting, but embarrassing.”</p>

<p>“I know Prince Sagramor,” said Sir Bleoberis
to Bragwaine. “We are going to the court, and
will take you to your father.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> will take me, Sir—Sir—”</p>

<p>“Sir Baffin,” explained Sir Bleoberis.</p>

<p>“Sir Baffin, will you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
“You can have my horse. I will walk.”</p>

<p>“I will ride upon your horse with you, and you
shall hold me on,” said Bragwaine.</p>

<p>“That is the custom,” said Bleoberis.</p>

<p>“But,” exclaimed the Professor with an air of
distress, “I am not used to riding double. I doubt
if I can manage the horse and hold you on at the
same time.”</p>

<p>“You need not hold me,” said Bragwaine laughingly;
“I will hold fast to you. I shall not fall.”</p>

<p>“But then—”</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> go with you,” said Bragwaine almost
tearfully. “You won me from the hands of that
villain, Lamorak, and I am not so ungrateful as to
leave you to cling to another person.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” exclaimed the Professor,
“this certainly is a very curious situation for a
man like me to find himself in. However, I will
do the best I can.”</p>

<p>Professor Baffin mounted his steed, and then Sir
Bleoberis swung the fair Bragwaine up to a place
on the saddle in front of the Professor. Bragwaine
clutched his coat-sleeve tightly; and although the
Professor felt that there was no real necessity that
she should attempt to preserve her equipoise by
pressing his shoulder strongly with her head, he
regarded the arrangement without very intense
indignation.</p>

<p>He found that he could ride very comfortably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
with two in the saddle, but he felt that his attention
could be given more effectively to the management
of the horse if Bragwaine would stop turning
her eyes up to his in that distracting manner so
frequently.</p>

<p>They rode along in silence for awhile. Suddenly
Bragwaine said:</p>

<p>“Sir Baffin?”</p>

<p>“Well; what?”</p>

<p>“Are you married?”</p>

<p>Professor Baffin hardly knew what answer he had
better give. After hesitating for a moment, he said:</p>

<p>“I have been.”</p>

<p>“Then your wife is dead?”</p>

<p>The Professor could not lie. He had to say
“Yes!”</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” murmured Bragwaine. “Not
that she is dead, but that you are free.”</p>

<p>Professor Baffin was afraid to ask why. He felt
that matters were becoming serious.</p>

<p>“And the reason is,” continued Bragwaine, “that
I have learned to love you better than I love any
other one on earth!”</p>

<p>She said this calmly, very modestly, and quite as
if it were a matter of course.</p>

<p>The Professor in astonishment looked at Sir Bleoberis,
who had heard Bragwaine’s words. The
Knight nodded to him pleasantly, and said, “I expected
this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Evidently it was not an unusual thing for ladies
so to express their feelings.</p>

<p>The somewhat bewildered Sir Baffin then said,
“Well, my dear child, it is very kind indeed for you
to regard me in that manner. I have done nothing
to deserve it.”</p>

<p>“You are my rescuer, my benefactor, my heart’s
idol!”</p>

<p>“Persons at my time of life,” said the Professor,
blushing, “have to be extremely careful. I will be
a father to you, of course! Oh, certainly, you may
count upon me being a father to you, right along.”</p>

<p>“I do not mean that I love you as a daughter.
You must marry me; you dear Sir Baffin.” Then
she actually patted his cheek.</p>

<p>Professor Baffin could feel the cold perspiration
trickling down his back.</p>

<p>“I think,” he said to Sir Bleoberis, “that this is,
everything considered, altogether <em>the</em> most stupendous
combination of circumstances that ever came
within the range of my observation. It is positively
distressing.”</p>

<p>“You will break my heart if you will not love
me,” said Bragwaine, as if she were going to cry.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” replied the bewildered Professor,
“we can consider the subject at some other time.
Your father, you know, might have other views,
and,—”</p>

<p>“The Prince, my father, will overwhelm you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
with gratitude for saving me. I know he will approve
of our marriage. I will persuade him to
have you knighted, and to secure for you some
high place at court.”</p>

<p>“That,” said the Professor, “would probably
make me acutely miserable for life.”</p>

<p>Within an hour or two after the fight with Sir
Lamorak, the Professor and his companions drew
near to Callion, the town in which King Brandegore
held his court.</p>

<p>Just before entering it they encountered Prince
Sagramor coming out with a retinue of knights in
pursuit of Sir Lamorak and his daughter. Naturally
he was filled with joy at finding that she had
been rescued and brought back to him.</p>

<p>After embracing her, he greeted Sir Bleoberis
and the Professor warmly, thanking them for the
service they had done to him. Bragwaine insisted
upon the Professor’s especial title to gratitude, and
when she had told with eloquence of his wisdom
and his valor, and had added to her story Sir Bleoberis’s
explanation of the Professor’s adventures,
the Prince saluted the latter, and said:</p>

<p>“There is only one way in which I can honor
you, Sir Baffin. I perceive that already you have
won the heart of this damsel. I had intended her
for another. But she is fairly yours. Take her,
gallant sir, and with her a loving father’s blessing!”</p>

<p>Bragwaine wept for happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
“But, your highness, if I might be permitted to
explain—” stammered the Professor.</p>

<p>“I know!” replied the Prince. “You will perhaps
say you are poor. It is nothing. I will make
you rich. It is enough for me that she loves you,
and that you return it.”</p>

<p>“I cannot sufficiently thank you for your kindness,”
said the Professor, “but really there is a—”</p>

<p>“If you are not noble, the King will cure that.
He wants such brave men as you are in his service,”
said the Prince.</p>

<p>“I am a free-born American citizen, and the
equal of any man on earth,” said the Professor
proudly, “but to tell you the honest truth, I—”</p>

<p>“You are not already married?” inquired the
Prince, somewhat suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I have been married; my wife is dead, and—”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you can marry Bragwaine.
Sir Colgrevance,” said the Prince to one of his attendants,
“ride over and tell the abbot that Bragwaine
will wish to be married to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” shrieked the Professor. “I really
must protest; you are much too sudden. I have
an important mission to fulfil, and I must attend to
that first, and at once.”</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis explained to the Prince the nature
of their errand, and told him the Professor’s daughter
was held as a hostage until he should bring
Ysolt back to Baron Bors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
“We will delay the wedding, then,” said the
Prince. “And now, let us ride homeward.”</p>

<p>If it had not been for the heart-rending manner
in which everybody regarded him as the future
husband of Bragwaine, and for the extreme tenderness
of that lady’s behavior toward him, the Professor
would have enjoyed hugely his sojourn at the
court. King Brandegore regarded him from the
first with high favor, and the sovereign’s conduct
of course sufficed to recommend the Professor to
everybody else. The Professor found the King to
be a man of rather large mind, and it was a continual
source of pleasure to the learned man to unfold
to the King, who listened with amazement and
admiration, the wonders of modern invention,
science, and discovery.</p>

<p>With what instruments the Professor’s ingenuity
could construct from the rude materials at hand;
he showed a number of experiments, chiefly electrical,
which so affected the King that he ordered the
regular court magician to be executed as a perfectly
hopeless humbug; but Professor Baffin’s
energetic protest saved the unhappy conjurer from
so sad a fate.</p>

<p>An extemporized telegraph line, a few hundred
yards in length, impressed the King more strongly
than any other thing, and not only did he make
to Sir Bleoberis and the Professor exclusive concessions
of the right to build lines within his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
dominions, but he promised to organize, at an early
day, a raid upon a neighboring sovereign, for the
purpose of obtaining plunder enough to give to the
enterprise a handsome subsidy.</p>

<p>Sir Dagonet did not come to court during the
Professor’s stay. But there, in full view of the
palace, a mile away in the lake, was his castle, and
in that castle was the lovely Ysolt.</p>

<p>The Professor examined the building frequently
through his field-glasses, which, by the way, the
King regarded with unspeakable admiration; and
more than once he thought he could distinguish
Ysolt sitting by the window of one of the towers
overlooking the lake.</p>

<p>The King several times sent to Sir Dagonet
messages commanding Sir Dagonet to bring the
damsel to him, but as Sir Dagonet invariably responded
by trying to brain the messenger or to
sink his boat, the King was forced to give it up as
a hopeless case. Storming the castle was out of
the question. None of the available boats were
large enough to carry more than half a dozen men,
and Sir Dagonet had many boats of great size
which he could man, so as to assail any hostile fleet
before it came beneath the castle wall.</p>

<p>But the Professor had a plan of his own, which
he was working out in secret, while he waited.
Sir Bleoberis had procured several skilful armorers,
and under the directions of the Professor they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
undertook to construct, in rather a crude fashion,
a small steam-engine. This, when the parts were
completed, was fitted into a boat with a propeller
screw, and when the craft was launched upon the
lake, the Professor was delighted to find that it
worked very nicely. The trial-trip was made at
night, so that the secret of the existence of such a
vessel might be kept from any of the friends of
Sir Dagonet who might be loitering about.</p>

<p>It devolved upon Sir Bleoberis, by bribing a
servant of Sir Dagonet’s who came ashore, to send
a message to Ysolt. She was ordered to watch at
a given hour upon a certain night for a signal
which should be given from a boat, beneath her
window, and then to leap fearlessly into the water.</p>

<p>The night chosen was to be the eve of the Professor’s
wedding-day. The more Prince Sagramor
saw of Professor Baffin and his feats, the more
strongly did he admire him; and in order to make
provision against any accident which should deprive
his daughter of marriage with so remarkable
a man, the Prince commanded the wedding-day to
be fixed positively, despite the remonstrances
which the Professor offered somewhat timidly, in
view of the extreme delicacy of the matter.</p>

<p>Upon the night in question, the Professor, at the
request of the King, who was very curious to have
an opportunity to learn from practical experience
the nature of the thing which the Professor called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
“a lecture,” undertook to deliver in the dining-room
of the palace the lecture upon Sociology,
which he had prepared for his course in England.</p>

<p>The room was packed, and the interest and curiosity
at first manifested were intense; but the
Professor spoke for an hour and three-quarters,
losing his place several times because of the
wretched character of the lights, and when he had
concluded, he was surprised to discover that his
entire audience was sound asleep.</p>

<p>At first he felt rather annoyed, but in an instant
he perceived that chance had arranged matters in
an extremely favorable manner.</p>

<p>It was within precisely half an hour of the time
when he was to be in the boat under the window
of Ysolt.</p>

<p>Stepping softly from the platform, he went upon
tiptoe from the room. Not a sleeper awoke.
Hurrying from the palace to the shore, he found
Sir Bleoberis sitting in the boat, and awaiting him
with impatience.</p>

<p>The Professor entered the craft, and applying a
lighted match to the wood beneath the boiler, he
pushed the boat away from the shore, and waited
until he could get steam enough to move with.</p>

<p>A few moments sufficed for this, and then, opening
the throttle-valve gently, the tiny steamer
sailed swiftly over the bosom of the lake, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the intense darkness, until the wall of the castle,
dark and gloomy, loomed up directly ahead.</p>

<p>A light was faintly burning in Ysolt’s chamber
in the tower, and the casement was open.</p>

<p>As the prow of the boat lightly touched the stones
of the wall and rested, Sir Bleoberis softly whistled.</p>

<p>“I have always been uncertain,” said the Professor
to himself, “if the ancients knew how to
whistle. This seems to indicate that they did
know how. It is extremely interesting. I must
remember to tell Tilly to note it in her journal.”</p>

<p>In response to the signal, a head appeared at the
casement, and a soft, sweet voice said:</p>

<p>“Is that you, darling?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it is I,” replied Sir Bleoberis. “Oh,
my love! my Ysolt!” he exclaimed, in an ecstasy.</p>

<p>“Is Sir Baffin there, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We are both here; and we have a swift
boat. Come to me at once, dear love, that we may
fly with you homeward.”</p>

<p>“I am not quite ready, love,” replied Ysolt.
“Will not you wait for a moment?”</p>

<p>“It is important,” said the Professor, “that we
should act quickly.”</p>

<p>“But I <em>must</em> fix up my hair,” returned Ysolt.
“I will hurry as much as I can.”</p>

<p>“Women,” said the Professor to his companion,
“are all alike. She would rather remain in prison
for life than come out with her hair mussed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
The occupants of the boat waited very impatiently
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Then Ysolt,
coming again to the window, said:</p>

<p>“Are you there, dearest?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sir Bleoberis, eagerly. “We are
all ready.”</p>

<p>“And there’s no time to lose,” added Professor
Baffin.</p>

<p>“Is your hair fixed?” asked the Knight.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Ysolt.</p>

<p>“Then come right down.”</p>

<p>“Would ten minutes more make any difference?”
asked Ysolt.</p>

<p>“It might ruin us,” replied the Professor.</p>

<p>“We can wait no longer, darling,” said Sir Bleoberis,
firmly.</p>

<p>“Then you will have to go without me,” said
Ysolt, with a tinge of bitterness. “It is simply
impossible for me to come till I get my bundle
packed.”</p>

<p>“We will wait, then,” returned Sir Bleoberis,
gloomily. Then he said to the Professor: “She
had no bundle with her when she was captured.”</p>

<p>The Professor, in silent desperation, banked his
fires, threw open the furnace-door, and began to
wonder what kind of chance he would have in the
event of a boiler explosion. Blowing off steam,
under the existing circumstances, was simply out
of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
After a delay of considerable duration, Ysolt’s
voice was heard again:</p>

<p>“Dearest!”</p>

<p>“What, love?” asked Sir Bleoberis.</p>

<p>“I am all ready now,” said Ysolt.</p>

<p>“So are we.”</p>

<p>“How must I get down?”</p>

<p>“Climb through the window and jump. You
will fall into the water, but I shall catch you and
place you in the boat.”</p>

<p>“But I shall get horridly wet!”</p>

<p>“Of course; but, darling, that can make no
great difference, so that you escape.”</p>

<p>“And spoil my clothes, too!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ysolt, I know; but—”</p>

<p>“I cannot do it; I am afraid.” And Ysolt began
to cry.</p>

<p>Wild despair filled the heart of Sir Bleoberis.</p>

<p>“I have a rope here,” said the Professor; “but
how are we to get it up to her?”</p>

<p>“Ysolt,” said Bleoberis, “if I throw you the end
of a rope, do you think you can catch it?”</p>

<p>“I will try.”</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis threw it. He threw it again. He
threw it thirteen times, and then Ysolt contrived
to catch it.</p>

<p>“What shall I do with it now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Tie it fast to something; to the bed, or anything,”
replied the Knight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
“Now what shall I do?” asked the maiden,
when she had made the rope secure.</p>

<p>“Slide right down into the boat,” said the Professor.</p>

<p>“It would ruin my hands,” said Ysolt, mournfully.</p>

<p>“Make the attempt, and hold on tightly,” said
Sir Bleoberis.</p>

<p>“We shall be caught if we stay here much
longer,” observed the Professor, with anxious
thoughts of the boiler.</p>

<p>“Good-bye then! I am lost. Go without me!
Save yourselves! Oh, this is terrible!” Ysolt began
again to cry.</p>

<p>“I will help her,” said Sir Bleoberis, seizing the
rope and clambering up the wall until he reached
the window.</p>

<p>Day began to dawn as he disappeared in the
room. The Professor started his fire afresh and
shut the furnace-door. Sir Bleoberis, he knew,
would bring down Ysolt without delay.</p>

<p>A moment later, the Knight seated himself upon
the stone sill of the window and caught the rope
with his feet and one of his hands. Then he placed
his arm about Ysolt, lifted her out and began to
descend.</p>

<p>Professor Baffin, even in his condition of intense
anxiety, could not fail to admire the splendid physical
strength of the Knight. When the pair were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
about half-way down, the rope broke, and Ysolt and
Sir Bleoberis were plunged into the lake.</p>

<p>The Professor, excited as he was by the accident,
remembered the boiler, and determined that
he would have to blow off steam and take the consequences;
so he threw open the valve, and instantly
the castle walls sent the fierce sound out
over the waters.</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis, with Ysolt upon his arm, managed
to swim to the side of the boat, and the Professor
after a severe effort lifted her in. Then he gave
his hand to the Knight, and as Sir Bleoberis’s foot
touched the side the Professor shut off steam,
opened his throttle-valve, backed the boat away
from the wall, and started for the shore.</p>

<p>It was now daylight. As the boat turned the
corner of the wall, it almost came into collision
with a boat in which, with ten oarsmen, sat Sir
Dagonet. The inmates of the castle had been
alarmed by the performances of the Professor’s
escape-pipe; and Sir Dagonet had come out to
ascertain the cause of the extraordinary noise.</p>

<p>The Professor’s presence of mind was perfect.
Turning his boat quickly to the right, he gave the
engine a full head of steam and shot away before
Sir Dagonet’s boat could stop its headway.</p>

<p>Sir Dagonet had perceived Ysolt, and recognized
Sir Bleoberis. White with rage he screamed to
them to stop, and he hurled at them terrible threats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
of vengeance if he should overtake them. As no
heed was given to him he urged his rowers to put
forth their mightiest efforts, and soon his boat was
in hot pursuit of that in which the maiden, the
Knight, and the Professor fled away from him.</p>

<p>By some means the people of the town of Callion
had had their attention drawn to the proceedings at
the castle, and now the shore was lined with spectators
who watched with eager interest the race between
Sir Dagonet’s boat and the wonderful craft
which had neither oars nor sails, and which sent a
long streamer of smoke from out its chimney.</p>

<p>Professor Baffin, positively determined not to
wed the daughter of Prince Sagramor, had prepared
a stratagem. He had sent three horses to the side
of the lake opposite to the town, and three or four
miles distant from it, with the intention of landing
there, and hurrying with Ysolt and Sir Bleoberis to
the home of Baron Bors, without the knowledge of
the Prince.</p>

<p>The daylight interfered, to some extent, with the
promise of the plan, but Professor Baffin resolved
to carry it out at any rate, taking what he considered
to be the tolerably good chances of success. He
turned the prow of his boat directly toward the
town, making as if he would go thither. The pursuers
followed fast, and as the Professor perceived
that he could easily outstrip them, he slowed his
engine somewhat, permitting Sir Dagonet to gain
upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
When he was within a few hundred yards of the
shore, close enough indeed, for him to perceive
that the King, Prince Sagramor, Bragwaine, and
all the attendants of the court were among those
who watched the race with excited interest, the
Professor suddenly turned his boat half around, and
putting the engine at its highest speed, ploughed
swiftly toward the opposite shore.</p>

<p>A mighty shout went up from the onlookers.
Manifestly the fugitives had the sympathy of the
crowd.</p>

<p>The oarsmen of Sir Dagonet worked right valiantly
to win the chase, but the steamer gained constantly
upon them; and when her keel grated upon
the sand, close by where the horses stood, the
pursuers were at least a third of a mile behind.</p>

<p>Sir Bleoberis sprang from the boat, and helped
Ysolt to alight. The Professor stopped to make
the fire in the furnace more brisk, and to tie down
the safety valve; then hurrying after Sir Bleoberis
and Ysolt, the three mounted their horses and
galloped away.</p>

<p>In a few moments they reached the top of a hill
which commanded a view of the lake. They stopped
and looked back. Sir Dagonet had just touched
the shore, but, as he had no horse, further pursuit
was useless. So, shaking his fist at the distant
party, he turned away with an affectation of contempt,
and entered the Professor’s boat to satisfy
his curiosity respecting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
“Let him be careful how he meddles with that,”
said the Professor.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the boat was torn to fragments.
Sir Dagonet and two of his men were seen to fall,
and a second afterwards the dull, heavy detonation
of an explosion reached the ears of the Professor
and his friends.</p>

<p>“It is dreadful,” said the Professor with a sigh,
“but self-preservation is the first law of nature,
and then he had no right to run away with Ysolt,
at any rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">HOW THE PROFESSOR WENT HOME.</span></h3>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_094.png" width="66" height="68" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword in02">The</span> three friends turned their horses’ heads
away from the lake, and pressed swiftly
along the road.</p>

<p>“It is necessary,” said Professor Baffin, “that
we should make good speed, for Prince Sagramor
saw us come to this side of the lake, and if he shall
suspect our design no doubt he will at once pursue
us, in behalf of that abominable girl, his daughter.”</p>

<p>The journey was made in silence during most of
the time, for the hard riding rendered conversation
exceedingly difficult, but whenever the party
reached the crest of a hill which commanded a
view of the road in the rear, the Professor looked
anxiously behind him to ascertain if anybody was
giving chase. When within a mile or two of
Lonazep, he did at last perceive what appeared
to be a group of horsemen at some distance behind
him, and although he felt by no means certain that
the Prince was among them, he nervously urged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
his companions forward, spurring, meantime, his
own horse furiously, in the hope that he might
reach the castle of Baron Bors ere he should be
overtaken.</p>

<p>As the party came within sight of the castle,
they could hear the hoofs of the horses of the pursuers,
and soon their ears were assailed by cries,
demanding that they should stop. It was, indeed,
Prince Sagramor and his knights, who were following
fast. The Professor galloped more furiously
than ever when he ascertained the truth, and Sir
Bleoberis and Ysolt kept pace with him.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the drawbridge, however,
they were overtaken; and, as it was raised, they
were compelled to stop and meet the Prince face to
face. The Professor hurriedly called to the warder
to lower the bridge, so that Ysolt could take refuge
in the castle. Then he turned, and determined to
make the best of the situation. The Prince was
disposed to be conciliatory.</p>

<p>“We came,” he said, “to escort you back again.
We have a guard of honor here fitting for any
bridegroom.”</p>

<p>“You are uncommonly kind,” replied the Professor,
“but the parade is rather unnecessary. I
am not going back just at present.”</p>

<p>“I promised Bragwaine that you would return
with us,” said the Prince, sternly.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought not to make rash promises,”
replied the Professor, with firmness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
“You will go, of course?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will not go.”</p>

<p>“Bragwaine is waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“That,” said the Professor, “is a matter of perfect
indifference to me.”</p>

<p>“I will not be trifled with, sir,” said the Prince,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Nor will I,” exclaimed the Professor. “Let us
understand one another. I do not wish to marry
any one. I did not ask your daughter to marry
me, and I have never consented to the union. I
tell you now that I positively and absolutely refuse
to be forced to marry her or any other woman. I
will do as I please about it; not as you please.”</p>

<p>“Seize him,” shrieked the Prince to his attendants.</p>

<p>“Stand off,” said the Professor, presenting his
revolver. “I’ll kill the man who approaches me.
I shall put up with this foolishness no longer.”</p>

<p>One of the knights rode toward him. The Professor
fired, and the cavalier’s horse rolled in the
dust. The Prince and his people were stupefied
with astonishment.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Baron Bors, Sir Dinadan, Sir
Agravaine, Sir Bleoberis, and Miss Baffin emerged
from the castle. Miss Baffin flew to her father,
and flung her arms about him. The Professor
kissed her tenderly, and as he did so, his eye
caught sight of the wire of the telephone which he
had arranged for Ysolt and Sir Bleoberis. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
happy thought struck him. Advancing, he said to
the Prince:</p>

<p>“It is useless for us to quarrel over this matter.
Baron Bors has here an oracle. Let us consult
that.”</p>

<p>Then the Professor whispered something to Miss
Baffin, who withdrew unobserved and went into
the castle.</p>

<p>The Prince was at first indisposed to condescend
to accept the offer, but his curiosity finally
overcame his pride.</p>

<p>“Step this way,” said the Professor. “Ask your
questions through this,” handing him the mouthpiece,
“and put this to your ear for the answer.”</p>

<p>“What shall I say?” inquired the Prince.</p>

<p>“Ask if it is right that I should marry your
daughter.”</p>

<p>The Prince put the question, and the answer
came.</p>

<p>“What does the oracle say?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“It says you shall not,” replied the Prince, looking
a good deal scared.</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied?” said the Professor.</p>

<p>The Prince did not answer, but he looked as if
he suspected a trick of some kind, and would like
to impale Professor Baffin with his lance, if he
dared.</p>

<p>He was about to turn away in disgust, when Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Agravaine, who stood beside him, in a few half-whispered
words explained to him the method by
which the Professor had imposed upon him.</p>

<p>In a raging fury, the Prince rode up to the Professor,
and would have assailed him; but Baron
Bors advanced and said:</p>

<p>“This gentleman is unarmed, and unused to our
methods of combat. He is my guest, and he has
saved my daughter. I will fight his battles.”</p>

<p>The Prince threw his glove at the Baron’s feet.
Baron Bors called for his armor and his horse, and
when he was ready he took his place opposite to
his antagonist, and waited the signal for the
contest.</p>

<p>“This,” said the Professor, “is probably the
most asinine proceeding upon record. Because I
won’t marry Sagramor’s daughter, Sagramor is
going to fight with a man who never saw his
daughter.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">At the first Shock both Knights were Unhorsed.</span></div></div>

<p>The combat was not a long one. At the first
shock both knights were unhorsed; but, drawing
their swords, they rushed together and hacked at
each other until the sparks flew in showers from
their armor.</p>

<p>The Baron fought well, but presently the
Prince’s sword struck his shoulder with a blow
which carried the blade down through the steel
plate, and caused the blood to spurt forth. The
Baron fell to the earth; and Prince Sagramor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
remembering the small number of his attendants,
and the probability that he might be assailed by
the Baron’s people, mounted his horse and slowly
trotted away without deigning to look at Professor
Baffin. They carried the Baron tenderly into the
castle, and put him to bed. The wound was a terrible
one, and the Professor perceived that the chances
of his recovery, under the rude medical treatment
that could be obtained, were not very favorable.
After doing what he could to help the sufferer, he
withdrew from the room, and left the Baron with
Lady Bors and the medical practitioner who was
ordinarily employed by the family.</p>

<p>Miss Baffin, with Sir Dinadan, awaited her father
in the hall. This was the first opportunity he had
had to greet her. After some preliminary conversation,
and after the Professor had expressed to Sir
Dinadan his regret that the Baron should have
been injured, the Professor said:</p>

<p>“And now, Tilly, my love, how have you been
employing yourself during my absence?”</p>

<p>Miss Baffin blushed.</p>

<p>“Have you kept the journal regularly?” asked
the Professor.</p>

<p>“Not so <em>very</em> regularly,” replied Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“I have a number of interesting and extraordinary
things for you to record,” said the Professor.
“Has nothing of a remarkable character happened
here during my absence?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
“Oh, yes,” said Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“I have learned to smoke,” said Sir Dinadan.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said the Professor with a slight pang.
“And how many cigars have you smoked?”</p>

<p>“Only one,” replied the Knight. “It made me
ill for two days. I think, perhaps, I shall give up
smoking.”</p>

<p>“I would advise you to. It is a bad habit,” said
the Professor, “and expensive. And then, you
know, cigars are so dreadfully scarce, too.”</p>

<p>“The Lady Tilly was very kind to me while I
was ill. I believe I was delirious once or twice;
and I was so touched by her sweet patience that I
again proposed to her.”</p>

<p>“While you were delirious?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; when I had recovered.”</p>

<p>“What did you say to that, Tilly?” asked Professor
Baffin.</p>

<p>“I referred him to you,” replied Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“But what will the Baron say?” asked the
Professor.</p>

<p>“He and my mother have given their consent,”
said Sir Dinadan. “They declared that I could
not have pleased them better than by making such
a choice.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said the Professor, reflectively.
“I like you first-rate, and if I felt certain
we were going to stay here—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
“I will go with you if you leave the island,” said
Sir Dinadan, eagerly.</p>

<p>“And then you know, Din,” continued the Professor
familiarly, “Tilly is highly educated, while
you—Well, you know you must learn to read, and
write, and cipher, the very first thing.”</p>

<p>“I have been giving him lessons while you were
away,” said Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>“How does he get along?”</p>

<p>“Quite well. He can do short division with a
little help, and he has learned as far as the eighth
line in the multiplication table.”</p>

<p>“Eight eights are sixty-four, eight nines are
seventy-two, eight tens are eighty,” said Sir Dinadan,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Professor, “if Tilly loves you,
and you love Tilly, I shall make no objection.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” exclaimed both of the lovers.</p>

<p>“But, I tell you what, Din, you are getting a
good bargain. There is no finer girl, or a smarter
one either, on the globe. You people here cannot
half appreciate her.”</p>

<p>For more than a week, Baron Bors failed to
show any signs of improvement, and the Professor
thought he perceived clearly that his case was fast
getting beyond hope. He deemed it prudent, however,
to keep his opinion from the members of
the Baron’s family. But the Baron himself soon
reached the same conclusion, and one day Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Bors came out of his room to summon Sir Dinadan,
Ysolt, Sir Bleoberis, who was now formally
betrothed to Ysolt, and the Professor, to the
Baron’s bedside.</p>

<p>The Baron said to them, in a feeble voice, that
he felt his end approaching, and that he desired to
give some instructions, and to say farewell to his
family. Then he addressed himself first to Sir
Dinadan, and next to Ysolt. When he had finished
speaking to them he said to Lady <span class="locked">Bors,—</span></p>

<p>“And now, Ettard, a final word to you. I am
going away, and you will need another friend,
protector, companion, husband. Have you ever
thought of any one whom you should like, other
than me?”</p>

<p>“Never, never, never,” said Lady Bors, sobbing.</p>

<p>“Let me advise you, then. Who would be more
likely to fill my place in your heart acceptably than
our good and wise and wonderful friend Sir Baffin?”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed the Professor with
a start.</p>

<p>“Your son is to marry his daughter; and she
will be happy to be here with him in the castle.
Promise me that you will try to love him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will try,” said Lady Bors, wiping her
eyes and seeming, upon the whole, rather more
cheerful.</p>

<p>“That,” said the Baron, “does not altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
satisfy me. I place upon you my command that
you shall marry him. Will you consent to obey?”</p>

<p>“I will consent to anything, so that your last
hour may be happier,” said Lady Bors with an air
of resignation. She was supported during the
trial, perhaps, by the reflection that in dealing with
lumbago Professor Baffin had no superior in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>Father Anselm was announced. “Withdraw,
now,” said the Baron to all of his family but Lady
Bors. “I must speak with the Hermit.”</p>

<p>Professor Baffin encountered the Hermit at the
door. The holy man stopped long enough to say
that a huge ship had come near to the shore upon
which the Professor had landed, and that it was
anchored there. From its mast, Father Anselm
said, fluttered a banner of red and white stripes
with a starry field of blue.</p>

<p>The Professor’s heart beat fast. For a moment
he could hardly control his emotion. He resolved
to go at once to the shore and to take his daughter
with him. Withdrawing her from her companions
the two strolled slowly out from the castle into the
park. Then, hastening their steps, they passed
towards the shore. In a few moments they
reached it, and there, sure enough, they saw a
barque at anchor, while from her mast-head floated
the American flag.</p>

<p>A boat belonging to the barque had come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
the shore to obtain water from the stream. Professor
Baffin entered into conversation with the
officer who commanded the boat. The vessel
proved to be the <i>Mary L. Simpson</i>, of Martha’s
Vineyard, bound from the Azores to New York.
When the Professor had explained to the officer
that he and his daughter were Americans, the
mate invited them to come aboard so that he could
introduce them to the captain.</p>

<p>“Shall we go, my child?” asked the Professor.</p>

<p>“If we can return in a very few moments, we
might go,” said Miss Baffin.</p>

<p>They entered the boat, and when they reached
the vessel, they were warmly greeted by Captain
Magruder.</p>

<p>While they were talking with him in his cabin
the air suddenly darkened, and the captain rushed
out upon deck. Almost before he reached it a
terrific gale struck the barque, and she began to
drag her anchors. Fortunately the wind blew off
shore, and the captain, weighing anchor, let the
barque drive right out to sea. The Professor was
about to remark to Miss Baffin that he feared there
was small chance of his ever seeing the island
again, when a lurch of the vessel threw him over.
His head struck the sharp corner of the captain’s
chest, and he became unconscious.</p>

<p>When Professor Baffin regained his senses, he
found that he was lying in a berth in a ship’s cabin.
Some one was sitting beside <span class="locked">him,—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
“Is that you, Tilly?” he asked, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, pa; I am glad you are conscious again.
Can I give you anything?”</p>

<p>“Have I been long unconscious, Tilly?”</p>

<p>“You have been very ill for several days; delirious
sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Is the captain going back to the island?”</p>

<p>“Going back to the <em>what</em>, pa?”</p>

<p>“To the Island. It must have seemed dreadfully
heartless for us to leave the castle while the
Baron was dying.”</p>

<p>“While the Baron was dying! What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, Baron Bors could not have lived much
longer. I am afraid Sir Dinadan will think hard
of us.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea what you are talking
about. Poor pa! your mind is beginning to wander
again. Turn over, and try to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Professor Baffin was silent for a moment. Then
he <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Tilly, do you mean to say you never heard of
Baron Bors?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“And that you were never engaged to Sir Dinadan?”</p>

<p>“Pa, how absurd! Who are these people?”</p>

<p>“Were you not upon the island with me, at the
castle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
“How could we have gone upon an island, pa,
when we were taken from the raft by the ship?”</p>

<p>“Tilly, my child, when I get perfectly well I
shall have to tell you of the most extraordinary
series of circumstances that has come under my
observation during the whole course of my existence!”</p>

<p>Then Professor Baffin closed his eyes and fell
into a doze, and Miss Baffin went up to tell the
surgeon of the ship <i>Undine</i>, from Philadelphia to
Glasgow, that her father seemed to be getting
better.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE COWDRICKS.—A CONJUGAL CHAT.—LEONIE.—A
RISING ARTIST.—A PROPOSAL.—SWEETHEARTS.</p></blockquote>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_107.png" width="66" height="68" alt="O" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">Occupying</span> a very comfortable position in
an easy-chair, Mr. Cowdrick, banker, sat
in his library before a blazing fire.</p>

<p>The Fate that arranges coincidences, and provides
for the fitness of things, could not have
persuaded Mr. Cowdrick to choose a more characteristic
method of warming himself; for it was a
sham fire. Some skilful worker in clay had produced
a counterfeit presentment of a heap of logs,
with the bark, the bits of moss, the knots, and the
drops of sap exuding from the ends, all admirably
imitative of nature. But the logs were hollow, and
a hidden pipe, upon occasion, filled them with gas,
which, as it escaped through imperceptible holes,
was ignited, to burn as though it fed upon the
inconsumable logs.</p>

<p>The library room was handsomely decorated in
accordance with the prevailing modes. Upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
wall were fastened porcelain plates, bearing beautiful
designs, but wholly useless for the purpose for
which plates were originally devised. Mr. Cowdrick
realized that as a mere matter of reason it
would be as sensible to put a fireplace in the ceiling,
or to cover his library table with the door-mat,
as to adorn his wall with a dinner-plate; but, like
some of the rest of us Mr. Cowdrick surrendered
his private convictions to the suggestions of
fashion.</p>

<p>Upon Mr. Cowdrick’s shelves and mantels were
cups and saucers of curious wares, which were to
be looked at and not used; and in his cabinets
were jugs and bottles, which existed that they
might contribute to the pleasure of the eye rather
than to the pleasure of the palate. The bookcases,
made with the best art of the workman, after
the most approved designs, were filled with richly-bound
volumes, into which Mr. Cowdrick had
never cared to look since he bought them by the
cubic foot; and which, in some instances, considered
themes which would not have interested
the banker in the slightest degree, even if he had
examined them, and had been gifted with the capacity
to comprehend them.</p>

<p>Upon the mantel ticked a clock, so fine that it
had to be kept under glass, and which had never
been known to indicate the time correctly during
twenty-four consecutive hours. The chairs and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
sofas were made of material so costly that Mrs.
Cowdrick had them draped continually in closely-fitting
brown-linen covers, so that, in fact, it was
somewhat difficult to comprehend why the expensive
and delicate fabrics beneath should have
been employed at all, seeing that they were perpetually
doomed to hide their loveliness.</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick sat looking at the deceitful fire in
front of him, and as he mused he smoked an excellent
cigar. His reverie was presently disturbed
by the entrance of Mrs. Cowdrick to the room.
Mrs. Cowdrick was a woman in middle life, of
rounded figure and pleasing face; and she was
clad, at this moment, in rich and tasteful dress.
She held in her hand a bit of canvas, upon which
she was working, in worsted, a pattern which was
intended to convey to the observer the impression
that it was of Japanese origin; but really it was as
great a sham as Mr. Cowdrick’s fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cowdrick drew a chair near to that of her
husband. Her first act, when she had taken her
seat, was to clap her hands vigorously together
two or three times, in ineffectual efforts to catch
and to crush a fluttering moth-fly.</p>

<p>This is a form of exercise that is very dear to the
female heart, but rarely is it productive of any
practical results. Calculated in horse-powers, it
may fairly be estimated that the amount of force
expended annually by the sex upon the work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
annihilating moth-flies would be sufficient to raise
one pound two hundred thousand feet high, if
any one cared to have a pound at such an
elevation; while it is probable that the number of
moth-flies actually taken upon the wing within the
boundaries of civilization, does not in any one year
exceed a few hundreds.</p>

<p>When she had concluded her efforts, without at
all injuring the insect, Mrs. Cowdrick resumed her
worsted attempt to insult Japanese art, and, as she
did so, Mr. Cowdrick, turning his head about
lazily, as he sent a whiff of smoke into the air, <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Annie, dear, where is Leonie?”</p>

<p>“She is in her room, I think,” replied Mrs. Cowdrick,
pleasantly. “She will be down in a few
moments.”</p>

<p>“I wish to have a little talk with you about her,
my love,” said Mr. Cowdrick. “I have been thinking
that it is high time Leonie had found a husband.
Let me see; how old is she now?”</p>

<p>“In her twenty-ninth year, really,” replied Mrs.
Cowdrick; “but then, you know, she does not
acknowledge more than twenty-five years to her
friends. Leonie is an exceedingly prudent girl.”</p>

<p>“But, of course,” remarked Mr. Cowdrick, “she
cannot keep that up forever. As she grows older
she will have to allow a year or two, every now and
then; and, after a while, you know, people will
begin to count for themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
“I have urged that upon her,” said Mrs. Cowdrick,
“and I think she fully realizes it. Her hair
is becoming thinner every week, and there would
be no hope of her hiding the truth if the fashion
did not permit her easily to cover the bald place
upon the top of her head.”</p>

<p>“She is no longer the young girl she once was,”
said Mr. Cowdrick with an air of sadness which
seemed to indicate his disappointment at the refusal
of Time to make an exception in the case of
Leonie.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Cowdrick; “she is beginning to
ascertain that she has nerves, and she has to take
iron every morning. At the pic-nic in September
she tried to appear as girlish as she could; but I
noticed, while she was skipping the rope with those
little chits of Mrs. Parker’s, that she would catch
her breath convulsively every time she went up;
and you know she was in bed with lumbago for
three days afterward.”</p>

<p>“She must marry,” said Mr. Cowdrick, with
emphasis. “The case is getting desperate. I will
speak to her about it to-night. I wish her, before
I quit home, to have herself engaged to some one
who is able to support her handsomely.”</p>

<p>“How soon will it be necessary for you to fly?”
asked Mrs. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“Before the end of next week, at the very latest.
Matters are fast approaching a crisis at the bank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
We might have pulled through after the failure of
Snell and Adam, to whom, as one of the directors
was a partner, we lent a large sum upon bogus
collateral; and I did not despair even when Pinyard,
Moon and Company, with whom I had a
silent interest, went under just after obtaining that
last hundred thousand of us; but I heard to-day
that J. P. Hunn and Co. are very much embarrassed,
and as we have hypothecated some good
collaterals deposited with us by our best customers
in order to keep Hunn on his legs, his failure
will inevitably result in the exposure of the whole
business.”</p>

<p>“And how much, dear, is the bank short?” asked
Mrs. Cowdrick, kindly.</p>

<p>“A full million and a quarter at the lowest estimate.
We can’t tell exactly, because the accounts
have been so much falsified to hide the deficiency.
But the capital has gone, and with it the bulk of
the money belonging to the depositors; and as I
say, a whole lot of collateral securities, placed in
our hands by some of the best men in town. It’s
a bad business! They will make it hot for us, I
am afraid.”</p>

<p>“But then, dear, you will save something from
the wreck, you said?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Pinyard told me that he thought he
and I would come out with two or three hundred
thousand apiece, if we can manage the creditors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
his firm so that they will take twenty-five per cent.
of their claims in settlement. That, however, is
only a possibility.”</p>

<p>“If the crash is coming so soon,” said Mrs. Cowdrick,
with a thoughtful air, “there are some little
things I should like to get at once.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know, Henry, I want a sealskin
sacque for this winter, and I had thought of buying
a pair of plain diamond earrings. Couldn’t I get
them, say to-morrow, and have them charged, and
then let the dealers just come in with the rest of
your creditors when you arrange a settlement?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my love! get them immediately, of
course. It is your last chance. I have not yet
gotten into such a position that I cannot provide
comforts for my family! Tell Leonie to make any
little purchases she may need, also. I might as
well go to ruin for a large amount as for a small
one. A few hundreds more or less will not matter.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Cowdrick spoke, Leonie entered the
room. She was elegantly and fashionably dressed,
and her face was wreathed with smiles. She ran
up to her father as a child might have done, and
with a girlish laugh kissed him; then, drawing a
footstool close to him, she sat down beside him and
placed her arm upon his knee. Mr. Cowdrick
stroked her head affectionately, with a tenderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
that was partly induced by fondness and partly by
a recollection of what Mrs. Cowdrick had said of
Leonie’s method of disguising the bare place upon
her crown.</p>

<p>After reflecting for a moment in silence, Mr.
Cowdrick <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“I want to ask my little girl if she has lost her
heart to any one yet?”</p>

<p>Leonie blushed, and straightening herself up she
said nervously, but with traces of a smile about her
<span class="locked">lips,—</span></p>

<p>“Lost my heart, papa! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean, my dear child, that it is high time you
had obtained a husband and settled yourself for
life. It is important you should marry as speedily
as possible.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” said Leonie, hiding her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>“To speak plainly, darling,” said Mr. Cowdrick,
“your poor father’s affairs are in such a condition
that a judicious matrimonial alliance is almost necessary
to your future happiness. You understand me,
of course; I am not at all sure of my financial future.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” said Leonie.</p>

<p>“Of course you are,” replied Mr. Cowdrick, “but
being sorry is not enough. I should bear the calamity,
when it comes, much more bravely if I were
assured that my dear child had a good and affluent
husband to console her amid the troubles that will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
befall her family. Is there no one to whom you
could give your affection if you tried? If you tried
right hard, just to please your poor old papa?”</p>

<p>Leonie hesitated before answering, and then she
<span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Yes, papa, there is!”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear that! Who is it, darling?”</p>

<p>“You will not be angry with me, papa, if I tell
you, will you? I <em>have</em> given my love to some
one, and that some one is—is—Mr. Weems, the
artist!”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Mr. Cowdrick, in a voice
that indicated mingled surprise and indignation.
“Not Julius Weems, the painter?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you are actually engaged
to be married to that young man?” said
Mrs. Cowdrick, vehemently.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am engaged to him,” said Leonie, putting
her forehead down upon the arm of her father’s
chair. “He proposed to me on Tuesday, while
you were at the opera.”</p>

<p>“And you love him?” asked Mr. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Leonie, “I love him; of course
I love him, or I never would have accepted him.
But I don’t mean to say, positively and finally, that
I would refuse a better chance if it presented itself.
Julius is the only person who seems likely to want
me, and certainly he is a great deal better than nobody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
“Yes; but, my dear child,” observed Mr. Cowdrick,
“a mere husband is nothing. The circumstances
of the husband are everything.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Weems is poor as poverty,” added
Mrs. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, mamma, you are mistaken,” said
Leonie. “Julius is in very comfortable circumstances.
He has a very profitable business.”</p>

<p>“He has, has he?” said Mr. Cowdrick. “Well,
I can’t imagine where it can be. I never have
seen any of his pictures.”</p>

<p>“Why, papa,” rejoined Leonie with a slight
laugh. “Julius says that you have two of his
best works in your gallery.”</p>

<p>“I have,” exclaimed Mr. Cowdrick, in astonishment.
“I think not.”</p>

<p>“He says so, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Which are they?”</p>

<p>“Why, the ‘Leader and the Swan,’ by Correggio,
and the ‘St. Lawrence,’ by Titian.”</p>

<p>“Leonie, that is ridiculous,” said Mr. Cowdrick,
warmly.</p>

<p>“Perfectly absurd,” remarked Mrs. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“But Julius declares he really did paint them.
He says he paints nothing but ‘old masters’; that
they bring the best prices, and that there is always
an active demand for them. He wants me to
come to his studio to see a splendid Murillo he
has just finished. He is making money rapidly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
“In that case, Leonie,” said Mr. Cowdrick, with
a slight touch of bitterness, as he thought of the
prices he had paid for his Correggio and his Titian,
but with a certain cheerfulness, gained from his
suddenly formed resolution to realize on them to-morrow—“in
that case, we must regard Mr.
Weems differently. He appears at least to be an
enterprising young man, and possibly he may do
well.”</p>

<p>“You had better arrange to see him at once,
dear,” said Mrs. Cowdrick, “so that you can ascertain
what his income is, and how soon the wedding
can be arranged.”</p>

<p>“I will do so,” replied Mr. Cowdrick. “But my
child, did you tell him anything? Does he know
that you have already been engaged three times?
Does he know that you were affianced to old Mr.
Baxter, who gained your affection under the pretence
that he was a millionaire, only to tread upon
the holiest of your emotions with the scandalous
revelation that he was living upon a paltry pension?”</p>

<p>“No, papa, I did not think it worth while to
disturb Julius with such matters as that. What
does he care for my past? No more than I care
for his!”</p>

<p>“Do you think he suspects your age, dear?”
asked Mrs. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“I am certain he does not. You know I falsified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the date in the family Bible, and last evening I
got him to look over it with me, under pretense of
searching for a text. When I showed him the
record, laughingly, he pretended to be surprised.
He said he should never have supposed me to be a
day over twenty-three.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick slowly winked that one of his eyes
which was upon the side towards his wife, and then
he <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Well, Leonie, we will see about it. There are
some things about the match to recommend it,
although I cannot say Weems is precisely the
man I should have chosen for you. However, you
are the person who is most deeply interested, and
I suppose we must let you choose for yourself. I
wish you would ask Mr. Weems to call to see me
to-morrow evening concerning the matter.”</p>

<p>“He will be here to-night, papa,” replied Leonie.
“He said he would call to make a formal proposal
for my hand.”</p>

<p>“Very well; that will do nicely. The sooner
we reach a distinct understanding, the better.”</p>

<p>Before many moments had elapsed, Mr. Julius
Weems was announced by the servant, whereupon
Mrs. Cowdrick and Leonie withdrew. When Mr.
Weems entered the room, Mr. Cowdrick greeted
him politely, but with dignified gravity. Mr.
Weems was somewhat nervous. Mr. Cowdrick
clearly perceived that he had reduced himself to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
condition of misery with a resolution to obtain, if
possible during this visit, the paternal blessing upon
his proposed alliance with Leonie.</p>

<p>The current theory is that the most difficult of
the processes by which the state of marriage is approached,
is the first declaration of affection to the
object of it; and it may be possible that most men,
upon reviewing their conduct upon such occasions,
are inclined to believe that they made fools of
themselves. But, as a matter of fact, it is nearly
certain that those who make a careful survey of
their experiences will be likely to admit that the
most trying ordeal through which the lover is compelled
to go is that of ascertaining what opinion of
the matter is held by the father of his sweetheart.
If there is a reasonable certainty that the loved one
will accept him, he is at least sure of the most acute
and delicious sympathy when he summons up
courage enough to take her little hand in his and
to give voice to his feelings; and the difference of
sex enables the performance to assume the most
romantic aspect. But to face a cold, practical man
of the world with a lot of sentiment, and to plunge
boldly into an explanation to him of a fervid passion
which he regards in the prosiest fashion possible,
requires bravery of a very high order. And the
man who can approach such a task with perfect
self-possession, and positive command of his mental
faculties and of his utterance, has a nervous system
that ordinary men may envy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
For a moment after Mr. Weems seated himself
upon the other side of the fireplace from Mr. Cowdrick,
there was an embarrassing silence. Then
Mr. Cowdrick, to open the way for his visitor, remarked
that it had been a very disagreeable day.</p>

<p>“Very,” said Mr. Weems. “Uncommonly damp
and chilly, even for this time of year.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday was far from pleasant also,” observed
Mr. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it abominable?” replied Mr. Weems.
“There will be a great deal of sickness if this kind
of weather continues.”</p>

<p>“The prospect,” rejoined Mr. Cowdrick, “is that
it will. There are no signs of a clear day to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” returned Mr. Weems.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Cowdrick looked into the fire, and
relapsed into silence. The weather of the past,
the present, and the future having been considered,
there really seemed to be nothing more to be said
upon that particular topic. It would be curious to
ascertain what men, who are in a stress for something
to talk about, fall back upon in those regions
where there is steadfast sunshine during half of
every year, and unremitting rain during the other
half.</p>

<p>“How is Miss Leonie?” said Mr. Weems, suddenly,
and with an air of desperation.</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you,” answered Mr. Cowdrick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
“Well, Mr. Cowdrick, I called this evening to
speak to you about her,” continued Weems, with a
determination to make the plunge and have it over.</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. In fact, Mr. Cowdrick, your daughter
has consented to become my wife, and I wish to
obtain, if I may, your approval of the match. May
I have it?”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Weems, this is so unexpected. I
was so little prepared for such an announcement
that I hardly know what——. My answer would
depend somewhat upon circumstances, I may say,
I have no objection to you personally; but I know
nothing of your prospects in your profession.”</p>

<p>“They are first-rate. I sold a picture to-day for
five thousand dollars; and that is by no means an
infrequent occurrence.”</p>

<p>“Who bought it?”</p>

<p>“St. Cadmus’s church. It is an altar piece;
very handsome and old; by Michael Angelo. You
see, I give you my secret; in confidence, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Cowdrick, “I am a regular
attendant at St. Cadmus’s and I was one of four
subscribers for that picture. The balance of the
amount we made up by mortgaging the organ.
Mr. Tunicle, the incumbent, said it was indisputably
genuine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Mr. Weems, laughing; “if it
looks like a genuine one, and everybody thinks it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
genuine, what difference is there? The people are
every bit as happy as if it were real. If one of my
pictures sells better with the name of some old
chap who has been dead for two or three centuries
tagged to it, why shouldn’t I let it go in that way?
It does not hurt him, and it helps me.”</p>

<p>“From your point of view the theory is excellent;
but from mine, as the owner of a couple of
old masters, it looks a little thin.”</p>

<p>“Well, to be fair,” said Mr. Weems, “I acknowledge
that I painted those you have, but I am willing
to find you a market for them, to oblige you;
or I will sell you two or three more, if you prefer
it. I have just run off a fine Salvator Rosa, and a
Titian, as kind of ‘pot-boilers,’ and you can have
them for almost nothing if you want them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” said Mr. Cowdrick. “My
interest in art is gradually cooling off. And then,
besides, if you are going to turn out pictures every
time you want a suit of clothes, or a box of cigars,
it seems likely there will soon be a glut of old masters
in the market.”</p>

<p>“But to come back to the point, Mr. Cowdrick,”
said Mr. Weems. “What may I accept as your
decision respecting my claim to your daughter’s
hand?”</p>

<p>“Have you ever had an affair of this kind before,
Mr. Weems? Pardon me for asking. Is
Leonie your first love?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
“Well, you know, every man does foolish things
in his youth. I have been involved in one or two
trifling matters of the sort. But I am a careful
man, and to avoid any unpleasant demonstrations
in the future, I have procured formal decrees of
divorce from eleven different girls; all, in fact,
with whom I have ever had any acquaintance that
was at all sentimental. I obtained six decrees
from the State of Indiana, at a cost of ten dollars
apiece, and the remainder from Utah, at a little
higher rate.”</p>

<p>“And you were never married to any of the
parties?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! merely knew them; took them out
driving, or danced with them at balls. Some of
them are married to other men. But, you know, a
man is never certain what may happen; women
are so queer; and so I concluded to destroy all
the chances of anything turning up, and I have
the legal documents to show for it. Leonie’s happiness
is perfectly safe with me, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Your course seems to me a prudent one, at
any rate,” remarked Mr. Cowdrick; “but then, of
course, it is possible for a man to be a little too
far-sighted for the comfort of other people. How
do I know, for instance, that you haven’t taken
the precaution to file away among your papers a
divorce from Leonie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Mr. Weems, laughing, “you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
know I wouldn’t go quite that far. I admit that
I have half a dozen blank decrees, which I can
fill up to meet emergencies, but I pledge you my
word of honor that I will never put her name in
one. I love her too dearly.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe you would love her if she were
poor; or if she were to become poor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly; of course,” answered Mr.
Weems. And then he added mentally, “I wonder
if anything is the matter? I’ll inquire about the
old man’s financial standing the first thing in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Cowdrick, “I hardly know.
Leonie is very dear to me. I have not contemplated
an early marriage for her. It would be a
terrible wrench upon my heartstrings. What
would you do if I refused my consent?”</p>

<p>“Try to submit with what patience I could
command, I suppose. But you will not refuse, will
you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick did not respond at once. He had
rather cherished the hope that Weems would elope
with Leonie, and save him the expense of a wedding
outfit and of a wedding festival, besides relieving
him of all responsibility. But he saw now
that it would not be safe to take the chances.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Weems,” he said, at length, “so far as
I am concerned, I think I may say that if Leonie
wishes to marry you, she can. But we must ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
her mother about it. It will be a terrible shock to
poor Mrs. Cowdrick. I will call her in.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Cowdrick entered the room with
Leonie, Mr. Cowdrick <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“My dear, Mr. Weems, here, has formally proposed
for the hand of Leonie, and I have given my
consent, provided you also would do so.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cowdrick replied by a shriek, after which
she flung herself into a chair, and, with an expensive
handkerchief to her face, she sobbed hysterically.</p>

<p>“Ma is doing that to show how well she can
pose,” said Leonie, in a whisper to Weems. “She
used to be splendid in private theatricals.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cowdrick sprang up, and in tones of apparently
intense excitement she said,—“No, no! I
cannot let her go! It is impossible! It is so unexpected,
so sudden! My child, my poor, darling
child! To be torn ruthlessly from the arms of her
dear mother! I cannot bear it! It will kill me!”
and Mrs. Cowdrick flung her arms wildly about
Leonie and wept.</p>

<p>Leonie seemed quite calm. She lowered her
shoulder slightly, to incline her mother’s head, so
that her tears would fall upon the floor instead of
upon her dress.</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick comforted her, reasoned with her,
and showed her that, after all, Leonie’s happiness
was at stake. To promote her happiness, her parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
must be willing to make some sacrifices, and
she must try to brace herself to meet the trial, hard
as it was. Mrs. Cowdrick’s agitation gradually decreased,
as her husband spoke; and when she had
rested upon the sofa for a moment, and helped her
nerves by inhaling salts from a gilded smelling-bottle,
she said:</p>

<p>“If it must be, it must! Take her, Julius! Take
her, and love her, and cherish her, so that she will
never rue having been torn from the parental
nest!”</p>

<p>“I promise you faithfully to do my best,” replied
Mr. Weems.</p>

<p>“And now, my children,” said Mr. Cowdrick, as
his voice trembled with emotion, “I give you an
old man’s blessing! May you be happy in each
other’s love until life shall end!”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Cowdrick wiped his eyes, and taking
Mrs. Cowdrick on his arm, they went upstairs to
discuss some method by which the marriage could
be celebrated before the crash came at the bank.</p>

<p>“And you are mine at last, darling!” said Mr.
Weems, as he pushed his chair up close to Leonie’s
and took her hand in his.</p>

<p>In reply she nestled her head up against his
shoulder, and her thoughts went out dreamily over
the past. Old Mr. Baxter and her two other lovers
had made precisely the same remark to her under
similar circumstances, and she had responded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
them in the same manner. Life is an endless
round of repetitions.</p>

<p>“Sweet face!” said Mr. Weems, patting it tenderly,
as if he were a trifle uncertain of the permanent
nature of the color. “Did you know, darling,
that I put your face in one of my recent
pictures?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Julius! Did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I gave it to my full length of St.
Ethelberta, by Rubens.”</p>

<p>“Is it a good likeness?”</p>

<p>“I think it is. But,” said Mr. Weems thoughtfully,
“it didn’t sell! That is, I mean, no person
of really good taste has inspected it yet.”</p>

<p>“And you painted it because you loved me, did
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Certainly! Of course!”</p>

<p>“How fortunate it was that I could return your
love, wasn’t it? Julius, what would you have done
if I had refused you?”</p>

<p>“Done? Why, it would have mortified me dreadfully.
I don’t believe I should have had any appetite
for a week or more.”</p>

<p>“Some disappointed lovers,” said Leonie almost
reproachfully, and with an air of chagrin, “become
utterly desperate and try to take their own lives.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” replied Mr. Weems. “Dreadful,
isn’t it? But I generally try to bear up under
misery. It’s a duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
“Could you bear misery for my sake, Julius?
Do you think your love would endure if poverty
should overtake us? Bitter, blinding poverty?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I could,” replied Mr. Weems with a
renewed determination to discover in the morning
if Mr. Cowdrick’s credit had been impaired.</p>

<p>“You believe, then, that love in a cottage is a
possibility, do you, dear?” asked Leonie.</p>

<p>“Yes, darling; possible, but not fascinating.
My observation is that love, upon the whole, has a
better chance in a commodious mansion with all of
the modern conveniences; with gas, water and a
boy to answer the front-door bell. Love, darling, is
like some other things in this world—it thrives
better when it is comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought about our wedding, dear?”
asked Leonie. “Where will we go upon our wedding
journey? Wouldn’t it be splendid to take a
trip to Europe?”</p>

<p>The suggestion did not seem to excite any great
amount of enthusiasm in the heart of Mr. Weems.
He said: “It would be very nice, but I am afraid
it would be almost too expensive, unless your pa—Did
your pa say anything about it?” asked Julius,
with a faint expectation that Mr. Cowdrick may
have intended to include a handsome cheque among
the presents.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Leonie; “he said nothing. Only
I thought may-be you might want to go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
“So I do, my love, but business is a trifle dull
just now. I am afraid we shall have to wait until
the prevailing prejudice against Rubens and St.
Ethelberta blows over, as it were. I thought perhaps
we might make a short trip to Boston and
back. How would that suit you?”</p>

<p>“I would be satisfied with it, dear, of course,”
said Leonie.</p>

<p>Mr. Weems heard her answer with the serene
consciousness that he had a free pass for two over
that particular route, and that even upon a wedding
journey there would be no need to be actually
riotous in the matter of hotel expenses.</p>

<p>“And when we get home, and settle down, may
I keep a parrot, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Mr. Weems, “the question is
sudden and somewhat irrelevant, but I should think
you might; provided, of course, you selected one
that has not been taught to use profane language,
and to imitate a screeching wheelbarrow with too
great accuracy.”</p>

<p>“You are so kind! And, Julius?”</p>

<p>“What, sweet?”</p>

<p>“If papa should die, could dear mamma come to
live with us?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Leonie, suppose we postpone
the consideration of some of these distressing contingencies
until they actually present themselves!
I am perfectly willing to wrestle with a grief when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
it comes, but there is no use of putting crape on a
door-knocker until there is bereavement in the
family circle.”</p>

<p>“That is true, dear. And, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Well, my love?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you can’t come to see me, will you
write to me? I want you to send me, at least once
every day, a dear, kind, affectionate letter, full of
love; won’t you, dear?”</p>

<p>“I will, if you will promise faithfully to burn
them,” replied Julius, as his prudent mind grasped
the possibility of some unfortunate future misunderstanding,
in which ardent love-letters might have a
damaging effect upon the case of the defendant.
“That is, pretty nearly every day.”</p>

<p>“Thus far,” continued Leonie, “I have kept all
that you have written. I have read them over, and
over, and over, and kissed them again and again.
The sweet verses you have sent to me I have
learned by heart.”</p>

<p>“Have you, darling?” said Mr. Weems, with a
feeling of pride in his success as a poet.</p>

<p>“Shall I repeat them to you?”</p>

<p>“If you will, dearest,” replied Mr. Weems, with
the air of a man who was conscious that he had
turned off rather a good thing in the way of verses.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Leonie, leaning back in her
chair, “how do they begin? Oh, yes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p class="in0">“Are they not beautiful?” asked Leonie, as she
concluded.</p>

<p>“Very beautiful,” responded Mr. Weems, with a
faint impression that it might perhaps pay him to
abandon the old masters, and to grasp the resounding
lyre, with a resolution to thrum it during the
remainder of his life.</p>

<p>“‘Sweetheart’ is a name I always liked,” said
Leonie. “You called me your ‘rosebud,’ in your
last letter; but somehow it did not please me so
much as ‘sweetheart;’ it was not so natural.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five years <em>is</em> old for a rosebud,” said
Mr. Weems, absently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Leonie; “and does it not seem
odd, Julius, that we who have been apart so long
should now be united forever, and that we should
go down the current of time together until the
end?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
While she was speaking, the elegant clock, from
beneath its crystal covering, chimed out the hour
of <em>four</em>, and the artist, consulting his watch, discovered
that the correct time was precisely ten
minutes past eleven. He arose from his seat, and
fondly embracing Leonie, he kissed her, and bade
her good night. She went to the window, and as,
by the light of the street lamp, she saw him descending
the steps in front of the house, she
waved her hand toward him. Then turning, she
proceeded to the hall, and up the stairs to bed,
murmuring to <span class="locked">herself,—</span></p>

<p>“Burn them! That <em>would</em> be insane!”</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">SAINT CADMUS’S.—CHURCH MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE.—FATHER
KRUM AND FATHER TUNICLE.—A RIOTOUS SERVICE.</p></blockquote>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_133.png" width="66" height="68" alt="M" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">Mr. Cowdrick</span>, although making no
profession of a special fondness for a religious
life, was one of the pillars of St.
Cadmus’s Church. He had been elected to a place
in the vestry; he held two pews; he contributed
upon occasion to the Church fund; and Rev. Mr.
Tunicle, who was “an advanced Ritualist,” found
in Mr. Cowdrick an ardent supporter whenever he
undertook to introduce innovations in his method
of conducting the services.</p>

<p>It did not seem important to Mr. Cowdrick that
Mr. Tunicle should always try to produce from the
records of the early Church his authority for any
new and surprising practice that he wished to
adopt. If the thing seemed to Mr. Cowdrick good
in itself, if it pleased his eye, and gratified what he
chose to consider the æsthetic demands of his
nature, he deemed it unnecessary to ask any more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
questions. He would as soon have thought of
inquiring, before he bought a new chair for his
library, or a new set of plate for his table, whether
his grandfather had established any precedent in
the matter of the purchase of chairs and dishes, as
to have sought in ecclesiological history warrant
for the embellishment of the services at St. Cadmus’s.
It was enough that the worshipers who
had the most money, and who were able to pay for
novelties, wanted them.</p>

<p>Mr. Tunicle, or Father Tunicle, as his most enthusiastic
admirers called him, was a frequent visitor
at the house of Mr. Cowdrick. Not only did
he find there a great deal of sympathy with his
plans, but he liked the society of Leonie, and he
was exceedingly anxious to enlist her among the
active workers in the church.</p>

<p>He called upon Leonie one evening, shortly
after her betrothal to Mr. Weems; and as the
artist happened to be out of town, Father Tunicle
had an opportunity to enjoy some uninterrupted
conversation with the young lady.</p>

<p>“I noticed last Sunday, Father Tunicle,” said
Leonie, after some preliminary conversation, “that
you did not use the velvet sermon-cover I worked
for you. I hope you are pleased with it?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, delighted with it. But then, you
know, I couldn’t use it last Sunday. The color
for the Third Sunday after Epiphany is green, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the sermon cover you know, is violet. I can use
it on Septuagesima Sunday, of course. We cannot
be too particular about these things in a world
that is lying in wickedness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me,” said Leonie. “I had gotten
the idea, somehow, that violet was the morning
color for last Sunday, and red the evening color.”</p>

<p>“You are thinking of Quinquagesima Sunday,
Miss Cowdrick,” said Father Tunicle, smiling
gravely. “The color changes upon that day.
You must study more carefully the little almanac
I gave you. When the Church provides us with
good books which may guide us to lives of earnest
devotion, it is our duty to read them attentively.”</p>

<p>“I will promise to do better in the future,”
said Leonie, meekly.</p>

<p>“I ought to tell you also,” continued Father
Tunicle, “that I could not use the Lavabo you
worked for me, at all.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Why?”</p>

<p>“Why, instead of making it of plain linen, you
made it of damask, and you embroidered it with
silk; whereas everything but French red marking
cotton or white marking cotton is expressly prohibited
by the rules. Nothing in the almanac is
stated in plainer terms than this. St. Paul, you
know, insisted that things should be done decently
and in order, and we are bound to heed his injunction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
“Ah, Father Tunicle, I am afraid I neglect St.
Paul as much as I do my almanac. Will you believe
I really didn’t know that he says anything
about plain linen and French red marking cotton?
I plead guilty.”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Cowdrick, you misunderstand me. I
did not mean to indicate that the apostle is the
authority for these things. Unhappily he does
not allude to them. Whether he ought to have
done so, is another question. Our authority for
them is more recent, but it is not to be despised
upon that account.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“I have great difficulty in impressing the importance
of these things upon the minds of some
of our people. Despite my repeated injunctions,
Mrs. Battersby brought back from the laundry the
altar-cloth filled with starch, and in the midst of
my distress over the discovery of this sacrilege, I
perceived that the sexton had omitted to pin the
fringe to the super-frontal. If we are to be made
perfect through suffering, I feel that I am not far
from perfection, unless these distressing occurrences
shall cease.”</p>

<p>“It is terrible,” said Leonie, with tender sympathy
in her voice.</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Cowdrick,” said the pastor,
“to turn to pleasanter themes. Cannot I enlist
your more active interest in our church work?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Will you not come into the Sunday-school as a
teacher?”</p>

<p>“I am not competent to teach, I fear.”</p>

<p>“We can give you a class of girls or a class of
boys, as you prefer. The boys’ class, which is
named, ‘Little Lambs of the Flock,’ is, I fear,
somewhat too unruly for you. Miss Bunner gave
it up because the scholars would persist in pinching
each other and quarrelling during the lesson.
They are so rough and boisterous that I think it
will be better to get a male teacher to manage
them. But you could take the girls’ class, ‘The
Zealous Workers,’ and perhaps persuade the pupils
to surrender their present indifference to everything
that is being done in either the Sunday-school
or the church.”</p>

<p>“I will consider the matter, and let you have
my answer as speedily as possible,” replied Leonie.</p>

<p>“Do, please. And I must speak to your father
again about my assistant, Father Krum. He is
not in sympathy with me, and it would be better
for both of us if he could be removed.”</p>

<p>“It is so unfortunate,” said Leonie.</p>

<p>“I have told him repeatedly that his stole must
always match the color of the frontal of the altar;
but you perhaps noticed last Sunday that he came
in with a black stole, and, of course, with a green
frontal, all hope of a harmonious combination of
colors was gone. It spoiled the entire service for
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
“For me too,” said Leonie.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think Krum is wilfully perverse
and obstinate. Upon several recent occasions he
has read the Epistle upon the Gospel side, and the
Gospel upon the Epistle side, and when I remonstrated
with him, after church, he was positively
offensive. He said that if the people only listened
to the Scripture and heeded it, he couldn’t see
why it made any difference whether he stood upon
one side or the other, or balanced himself on top
of the chancel rail. Scandalous, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly scandalous.”</p>

<p>“He seems to take pleasure in destroying the
effect of the finest groupings that I arrange in
the chancel with him and the acolytes; and when
I proposed to introduce an orchestra, led by Professor
Batterini, whom I should dress in a surplice,
Krum had the insolence to say that he did not believe
that there was any use of trying to preach the
Gospel to the poor with a brass band. The man
seems to be lost to all sense of reverence.”</p>

<p>“Entirely lost,” said Leonie.</p>

<p>“And as for praying to the east, that he appears
determined not to do. Of course, with the incorrect
orientation of the church, we have only a
‘supposititious east,’ and Krum insists that if I have
a right to suppose the north-northwest, I think it
is, to be the east, he is equally entitled to suppose
the southwest or due south to be east, and so he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
does as he pleases. When he said, the other day,
that in his opinion more depended upon the frame
of mind in which the prayers were said, than upon
the particular point of the compass towards which
the supplications were presented, I did not answer
him. Such a man is almost beyond the reach
of argument.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick came in while Father Tunicle was
speaking; and when the good pastor had rehearsed
his grievances to the banker, Mr. Cowdrick <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Father Krum’s conduct is subversive of good
order and of authority; and if he is allowed to continue
he will demoralize the entire congregation.
He ought to remember what the Bible says about
submitting reverently to one’s pastors and spiritual
masters. You are his pastor and spiritual master.
Isaiah, isn’t it, who says that?”</p>

<p>“The quotation, though somewhat inexact,” replied
Father Tunicle, “is from the Catechism.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, he ought to do as you want him
to do. That is what we pay him for. And if he
refuses to do it, he ought to be dismissed.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Father Tunicle, “will be difficult
to do while he has at least half of the vestrymen
with him. I am sorry to say that his obstinacy is
countenanced and approved by a number of the
lay officers of the church.”</p>

<p>“Then we must use force!” exclaimed Mr. Cowdrick.
“If we men who put down our money to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
keep the church in operation cannot be allowed to
do as we please, we had better stop contributing.
The people who pay for spreading the glad tidings
of the Gospel ought to be allowed to spread them
in their own way.”</p>

<p>“Matters,” said Father Tunicle, “are fast approaching
a point where something will have to be
done. Three times I have instructed Krum to extend
only three of his fingers when he pronounces
absolution, but he continues to hold out his entire
hand, with all his fingers wide open. The last time
he did it I noticed that Mrs. Lindsay, who is one
of our party, got up and left the church in a rage.”</p>

<p>“I saw her go out,” said Leonie. “That was
the first Sunday upon which she wore her purple
velvet bonnet. Everybody was looking at her.”</p>

<p>“If he does it again,” said Mr. Cowdrick, “I am
in favor of shutting the church doors against him
and his friends. Peremptory action of some kind
becomes a necessity in cases like this.”</p>

<p>After some further conversation relative to ecclesiastical
and secular matters, Father Tunicle
took his leave, and went home, probing the deep
recesses of his mind, as he walked along, to find
some plan by which he might successfully overcome
the resistance offered by the perverse Father
Krum to the evangelization of a fallen race.</p>

<p>The next Sunday morning was bright and beautiful.
The air was cold, but the sun shone from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
clear sky to tempt from their homes the worshipers
who, however willing to brave, on week-days,
terrific storms sent to keep them from shopping
excursions and parties, have not nerve enough
upon Sundays to face a cloud no larger than a
man’s hand.</p>

<p>Those persons who, upon devotional errands intent,
walked along the footway near St. Cadmus’s
church at the hour of morning prayer, perceived
that something of an unusual and exciting nature
was in progress in and about that purely Gothic
edifice. The many whose curiosity succeeded in
overcoming their desire to be punctual in their
attendance at the sanctuary, paused to observe
the proceedings.</p>

<p>A crisis had been reached in the quarrel between
Father Tunicle and Father Krum. As the
latter, in response to still another request that he
would extend but three fingers in his pronunciation
of the absolution, had positively, and indeed with
vehemence, refused to extend less than four, and
had gone so far as to indicate that, under serious
provocation, he might even thrust out eight fingers
and two thumbs, Father Tunicle’s party had resolved
that the time had come for them to act.</p>

<p>“It is a terrible thing to do,” said Father Tunicle;
“but the blood of the martyrs is the seed
of the Church; and we must stand up boldly for
truth and right, though we die for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
And so, upon that lovely Sunday morning, when
dumb Nature herself seemed to be trying to express,
with the glory of her sunshine, and with the
pure beauty of her azure sky, her sense of the
goodness of her Creator, Father Tunicle and six
of his vestrymen, reinforced by a few earnest sympathizers,
who were subsequently admitted through
a side door by a faithful sexton, took possession
of the church.</p>

<p>When Father Krum arrived, the faithful sexton,
keeping watch and ward at the aforesaid door,
refused to let him in; and when the indignant
clergyman demanded a reason for his exclusion,
the functionary informed him that his reckless conduct
in using four fingers and a thumb, instead of
the inferior number warranted by a strict regard
for the usages of the primitive Church, had persuaded
Father Tunicle and his partisans that, as a
shepherd of the sheep, he was a lamentable and
dismal, not to say dangerous, failure.</p>

<p>Then Father Krum, in a frame of mind that
contained no suggestion of Christian resignation,
walked rapidly around to the front of the church,
where he found a group of persons, members of
the congregation, who were standing before a
close-barred door, behind which, in the vestibule,
stood Father Tunicle and his adherents. While
Father Krum, in the mildest tones that he could
command, and with a proper desire not to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
any excitement, explained the situation to the
crowd, the six vestrymen who inclined to favor his
views, in opposition to those of Father Tunicle,
came up, one after the other.</p>

<p>They were taken completely by surprise, and felt
they were at a disadvantage. But after some preliminary
discussion, they called Mr. Krum aside,
and began to consider with him what should be
done. Mr. Krum counselled a retreat. His voice
was for peace. He urged that a resort to violence
at any time, but especially at such a time, would
be shocking. But the vestrymen did not agree
with him. Mr. Yetts declared that they had a
right to enter the church, and that for officers of
the church with authority co-equal with theirs to
deny that right, was simply monstrous, and not to
be endured. Mr. Palfrey, Mr. Green, and the other
vestrymen, expressed their full agreement with this
proposition.</p>

<p>“But let us try peaceful means, at any rate,”
said Mr. Krum. “I will knock at the door.”</p>

<p>He advanced and knocked. “Who is it?” said
a voice from within.</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Krum, six of the vestrymen, and a large
portion of the congregation. We wish to enter.”</p>

<p>“Can’t do it,” replied the voice, which was that
of the sexton, who had advanced to the front, and
had been thrown out upon the picket line in the
vestibule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
“Where is Father Tunicle?” asked Mr. Krum.</p>

<p>“He has just begun the service, and has gotten
as far as ‘dearly beloved brethren.’ My orders are
that you can’t get in until he says the apostolic
benediction!”</p>

<p>“Ask one of the vestrymen to come to the window
for a moment, please,” said Mr. Krum.</p>

<p>Presently one of the front windows was raised to
the height of two or three inches, and Mr. Cowdrick
peered through the wire netting that protected
it.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Mr. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“We wish to know,” said Mr. Yetts, “why we
are excluded from this church, and by whose
authority?”</p>

<p>“You are excluded,” said Mr. Cowdrick, “because
we who pay the expenses are determined to
run the church in our own way. The door is shut
by our authority; by mine!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” asked Mr. Krum, with
much mildness, “that you intend to try to make
this exclusion permanent?”</p>

<p>“Of course. We have possession and we intend
to keep it. Hurry up if you have anything to
say; I want to go in and help swell the responses.”</p>

<p>“See here, Cowdrick,” said Mr. Yetts, fiercely,
“if you don’t open that door, we will break it down.
We’re not going to stand any more of this nonsense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
“You’d better not try it,” replied Mr. Cowdrick.
“I shall summon the police to protect us if you
do.”</p>

<p>In response to this, Mr. Yetts advanced to the
door and kicked it three or four times, viciously.
The crowd, which had swollen until it covered the
pavement and filled the street, laughed at this demonstration.
Mr. Cowdrick, behind the window
netting, laughed also. Mr. Yetts, with crimson
face, retired in tolerably good order to consult with
his friends. Father Krum advised him to give it up.</p>

<p>“Give it up!” exclaimed Mr. Yetts. “I’ll show
you how I’ll give it up!”</p>

<p>Then he and Mr. Green went around the corner
for a little space, and returned presently with
a somewhat ponderous wooden beam. The four
other vestrymen manned it, and aimed it at the
door. Bang! went the end against the portal,
which bravely withstood the shock. The crowd
cheered, and a dozen boys, who regarded the performance
with delighted interest, crowded up behind
the assaulting column, and betrayed a desire
to give additional impetus to Mr. Yetts’ battering
ram.</p>

<p>The Krum section of the vestry made another
charge, striking the door with terrible force, but
still failing to effect a breach. At this moment
one of Father Tunicle’s acolytes emerged from the
side-door and attempted to glide down the street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
in search of a policeman. He was captured by
one of the besieging force, and held as a prisoner.
He brought the news that Father Tunicle had
stopped short in the service when the first blow
was struck against the door, and that the entire
garrison was now rallied in the vestibule, where
they were fortifying the portal with the baptismal
font, the episcopal chair, some Sunday-school
benches, and a lectern.</p>

<p>Mr. Krum remonstrated with Mr. Yetts, and entreated
him not to proceed any further. He urged
that it was a dreadful thing for Christian men to
create such a disturbance upon the Sabbath-day.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that!” replied Mr. Yetts,
who was now warm with wrath and with excitement.
“When Peter did wrong didn’t Paul ‘withstand
him to the face’?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, my dear Mr. Yetts, think of it!
St. Paul did not try to batter down the church door
on a Sunday morning with a log of wood! You
are going too far!”</p>

<p>“Times have changed since then,” said Mr.
Yetts. “Paul probably never encountered precisely
such an emergency. Once more!” exclaimed
Mr. Yetts to the assailants. “Give it to
’em hard this time!”</p>

<p>Seizing the beam, the vestrymen and their
friends advanced once more to the attack. Three
times was the door smitten without effect, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
when the fourth blow was struck it gave way, and
was flung wide open, revealing Father Tunicle and
his friends, standing amid a mass of overturned and
wrecked furniture, pale with rage and dismay, and
ready to defend with force the citadel which thus
was exposed to the enemy.</p>

<div id="ip_147" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_146.png" width="417" height="604" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Riotous Service.</span></div></div>

<p>The crowd sent up a shout of satisfaction, and the
intrepid Yetts, with his five vestrymen, regarded
their triumph with exultation.</p>

<p>What they would have done next, if they had
been permitted to press forward through the breach,
can only be imagined. For a moment it looked as
if beneath that spire which idly pointed these men
toward a better country, whence rage and hatred
and all evil passions are shut out, and beneath the
bell, whose function was to send vibrating through
the tremulous air its summons to the temple of
the Prince of Peace, there might be a hand-to-hand
encounter, in which priest and people should assail
each other with furious violence.</p>

<p>But, most happily, at this critical moment, a
squad of policemen came upon the scene, and
entering the doorway, separated the combatants
and prevented any further demonstration.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” exclaimed Mr. Yetts, shaking
his fist at the Father Tunicle faction. “We will
go to law about it. We shall see who has a right
to use this church!”</p>

<p>“As you please!” replied Mr. Sloper, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
vestrymen who adhered to Father Tunicle. “We
will fight you to the last gasp!”</p>

<p>And then both parties dispersed, leaving the
church in charge of the policemen, who closed the
door, and took the key to the nearest magistrate.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, the day’s proceedings, regarded
as the performance of Christian gentlemen,
citizens of a Christian country, upon the day designated
by Christianity as a day of peace and rest—as
a day of devotion to celestial and holy things,
could hardly be regarded as encouraging to those
hopeful persons who cherish the theory that the
world is to be made better by illustrations of the
excellence of the advantages of pure religion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF MR. COWDRICK.—THE
“CRAB.”—“HEAR BOTH SIDES.”—A SKELETON
DISCOVERED.—A POWERFUL SERMON.</p></blockquote>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_149.png" width="66" height="68" alt="B" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword in02">Before</span> another Sunday came, the community
was shocked and startled by the announcement
that Mr. Cowdrick, the banker,
had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. What
had become of him nobody seemed to know. Even
Mrs. Cowdrick apparently did not know. The
friends who promptly called upon her, partly for the
purpose of offering her their sympathy and partly
with an intent to gratify their curiosity, ascertained,
during the intervals of her hysterical
spasms, that she cherished a wild and rather incoherent
theory that Mr. Cowdrick had been brutally
assassinated by some person and for some cause
unknown. And this theory obtained some acceptance
for a time among amiable people, who were
disposed to take the most charitable view of the
situation. But the number of these speedily diminished
when the newspapers, a day or two later,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
revealed the result of an official examination of the
affairs of Mr. Cowdrick’s bank. The public then
learned that that financial institution was rotten
through and through; that Mr. Cowdrick and his
partners in crime had not only used, for purposes
of private speculation, the money of the depositors,
but that they had stolen everything of value that
had been committed to their care, and had left the
bank an absolute, hopeless wreck, and reduced the
innocent and unsuspicious stockholders to beggary.</p>

<p>The public excitement, of course, was great.
Mrs. Cowdrick’s friends neglected her. The rich
and influential De Flukes actually insulted her by
sending to recall an invitation to their reception
that had been sent to her. As if Mrs. Cowdrick
could have attended the reception at any rate!
This was the cruellest thing of all, to Mrs. Cowdrick.
She broke down completely and went to
bed, where Leonie waited upon her to supply her
with almost alarming quantities of camphor and
smelling-salts.</p>

<p>As no traces of the fugitive could be found; as
no one could testify to having seen him leave the
city; and as the detective force, after following out
without success any number of what they considered
excellent clues, appeared to have relapsed into a
normal condition of imbecility and indifference, the
conclusion reached by many persons was, that
Cowdrick had destroyed himself; and the energetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
and enterprising coroner, McSorley, who had just
been elected upon the Democratic ticket, went to
work to drag all the rivers and creeks and ponds in
the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Colonel Hoker, the editor of the <i>Crab</i>, the leading
daily paper, advocated a dozen different theories
in turn, and his indomitable reporters not only
secured early and accurate reports of the condition
of the bank, but they obtained expressions of
opinion from at least thirty eminent citizens who
really knew no more about the matter than other
people, and they watched Cowdrick’s house so
closely, and were so successful in establishing confidential
relations with the chambermaid, that they
were able to tell how often the doctor called to see
Mrs. Cowdrick, what quantity of reinvigorating
drugs she consumed, how her medicine agreed
with her, and what she had every day for dinner.</p>

<p>A country wherein a tyrant’s power is used to
shackle the press, and to rob it of freedom of utterance,
does not know how much it misses.</p>

<p>The uncertainty in which the fate of Mr. Cowdrick
was involved, made it exceedingly difficult
for Colonel Hoker to discuss the bank sensation in
his editorial columns. If he could have felt sure
that the unhappy fugitive had really slain himself,
the course of the Colonel would have been clear;
for then he could with safety have directed public
attention to the peculiar atrocity of the transactions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
at the bank; he could have held the miserable offender
up before the public eye to point to him
as an awful example to others, and especially to the
young, and he could have preached many eloquent
sermons upon the text, “Be sure your sins will
find you out!”</p>

<p>But while a chance remained that Cowdrick was
still alive and might return, the Colonel knew that
it was the duty of persons upon whom it devolved
to form public opinion through the instrumentality
of the press, to be careful. He had learned from
extended observation that an absent offender who
has been roughly used as a warning against pursuance
of the paths of vice, sometimes comes back,
and, after gaining possession of power and riches,
manifests a disposition to make things very uncomfortable
for the eminent journalists who have used
him as a basis for their denunciations of sin. And
so the Colonel discussed the matter in the <i>Crab</i>
only in a general way; lamenting the loss to the
stockholders; expressing regret that “one of our
most eminent citizens should be, for a time at
least, in some respects under a cloud,” and urging
that perhaps the disaster might fairly be attributed
to the spirit of wild speculation which seemed at
times to animate entire communities, rather than
to a deliberate purpose to inflict injury upon confiding
and innocent persons.</p>

<p>The dexterity displayed by Colonel Hoker, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
keeping the <i>Crab</i> in such a nice position that
while it apparently conceded much to public sentiment
and the requirements of morality, it yet left a
very wide margin for the contingency of Cowdrick’s
vindication and restoration to prosperity, was really
marvellous.</p>

<p>But the nicest ingenuity sometimes will not avail
against accident, or rather against that Fate which
ordains catastrophe with ironical contempt for human
foresight.</p>

<p>The Colonel was compelled to leave town for a
few days, and in order to make the <i>Crab</i> entirely
safe, he penned two editorial articles, one to be
used in the event of the discovery of Cowdrick’s
dead body during his absence, the other to be
inserted if Cowdrick should return alive to face his
accusers and his fate.</p>

<p>The former article ran in this <span class="locked">wise:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center wspace larger">“<span class="smcap">The Way of the Transgressor.</span></p>

<p>“It has not often been our lot to present to our
readers more striking proof than that which is
found in our columns to-day of the fact that Satan
makes hard bargains. It is now positively ascertained
that Cowdrick the swindler, forger and thief,
driven by desperation at the exposure of his awful
crimes, and, let us hope, for the sake of human nature,
by the stings of a conscience which could not
hearken with indifference to the cries of the widows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
and orphans reduced at one fell blow to beggary,
took his own life, and so ended a career of crime
which honest men shrink from contemplating. It
is, perhaps, for the best, however much we may
regret that this wretched felon, burdened with guilt
and shame, should have robbed the law of its right
to punish, and should have gone into eternity unshriven,
with the guilt of self-destruction added to
the mountain of sins for which already he was required
to give account. We shrink from discussion
of the dreadful details of this shocking and
sickening tragedy; but it will not have been enacted
in vain if it shall seem to warn those who are
tempted, as this man was, to surrender honesty at
the demand of greed, and to permit the maddening
thirst for gain to persuade them to trample in the
dust their obligations to society, to their families,
and to those who had given them their trust.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The second article pursued rather a different line
of thought. It was to the following <span class="locked">effect:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center wspace larger">“<span class="smcap">A Demand for Fair Play.</span></p>

<p>“We take a great deal of pleasure in announcing
that Henry P. Cowdrick, Esq., the well-known
banker, whose name has been before the public for
some days past in connection with some unpleasant,
but not yet positively authentic, rumors, has
returned to the city in the enjoyment of excellent
health. It is understood that an immediate further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
examination into the affairs of the bank will be
made with the assistance of Mr. Cowdrick, and we
merely express the general wish when we say that
we hope to have some of the transactions that have
excited severest comment explained in such a manner
as to vindicate Mr. Cowdrick of every suspicion
of wilful wrong-doing. Meantime, while this
inquiry is pending, and while Mr. Cowdrick is
preparing his statement of the case, it is only
just to him to ask that there shall be a suspension
of public opinion. His former high standing, his
services to this community, the obscurity in which
the recent operations of the bank are shrouded, and
the most ordinary requirements of fair play, all combine
to make it desirable that public opinion shall
not pronounce a final verdict before the case is made
up. We need not say how earnestly we trust that
Mr. Cowdrick will emerge from his troubles with
his honor unstained, and his reputation as a faithful
guardian of the trusts confided to him, untarnished.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As a precautionary measure, the preparation of
these articles appeared to be in a high sense judicious;
and the Colonel naturally felt that the <i>Crab</i>
might be depended on to keep nicely upon the
right track until he should come home. But, alas!
upon the next day but one after his departure, the
foreman of the <i>Crab</i> composing-room, either mistaking
his instructions, or being too much in haste
in arranging his material, placed both articles together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
in the form, and the <i>Crab</i> came out in the
morning to provoke the mirth of the town, to excite
the contempt of its enemies, and to drive the
unhappy associate editors of the paper to madness
and despair. The manner in which the rival journals
commented upon the occurrence was both
brutal and infamous; and when the subject became
a little stale, the editors of the rival journals put
the <i>Crab</i> articles carefully away in scrap books, so
as to make sure of having them ready for irritating
and badgering Colonel Hoker upon every favorable
opportunity during all the years to come.</p>

<p>The Colonel himself, upon discerning the catastrophe
in a copy of the paper which he picked up
at his hotel, expressed his feelings freely and
vehemently by telegraph, and then he started home
upon a fast express train for the purpose of explaining
his views more fully and precisely.</p>

<p>The <i>Crab</i> itself alluded to the subject only so far
as to suggest that the stupidity of an associate
editor was accountable for the performance, and to
hint that there was some reason for suspecting
that bribery had been employed by the owners of
rival papers, in the vain hope to bring the <i>Crab</i>, the
only really infallible journal published, into contempt.</p>

<p>The efforts of McSorley, the coroner, to demonstrate
the correctness of his theory of suicide were
indefatigable. The body not having been discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
in any of the streams, McSorley began to
search for it upon the land. The pursuit, however,
was not profitable, for no traces of Mr. Cowdrick
could be found. An ordinary coroner would
have abandoned the hunt in despair; but McSorley
was no common man. He brought to the
performance of the functions of his office an enthusiasm
which never failed to kindle at the promise
of a fee; and as, in this case, he was thoroughly
convinced that Cowdrick ought to have committed
suicide, he felt that for Cowdrick to have evaded
his duty in the matter would have been to perpetrate
a wanton outrage upon Coroner McSorley.</p>

<p>The following extract from the local reports in
the <i>Crab</i> will explain the character of the coroner’s
ultimate <span class="locked">effort:—</span></p>

<p>“Yesterday a number of large bones were discovered
beneath an old stable on Twelfth Street,
by some laborers. It was believed by most of the
spectators that they were the bones of a horse.
But Coroner McSorley, who was sent for, declared
at once his belief that they were portions of the
skeleton of one of our prominent citizens, a banker,
who has been missing for several days. This
view was contested by several of the persons present
upon the ground that the remains were absolutely
fleshless, and manifestly very old. But the
coroner, to demonstrate the accuracy of his view,
proceeded to arrange the bones upon the pavement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
in the form of a man. He succeeded in the
attempt to some extent, and was about to summon
his jury of inquest, when Dr. Wattles came up.
The doctor examined the skeleton, and then the
following conversation ensued between him and
Coroner <span class="locked">McSorley:—</span></p>

<p>“‘You don’t imagine that to be the skeleton of
a human being, do you, Mr. McSorley?’</p>

<p>“Certainly it is! Don’t you see the shape of it?’</p>

<p>“‘But, my dear sir, what you have arranged as
the spine, runs clear up through what you suppose
to be the skull, and projects two or three inches
beyond the top of the head.’</p>

<p>“‘Of course; and that is very likely the cause of
all the trouble. The man’s spine worked up into
his head and disordered his mind. An aunt of
mine, in Wisconsin, went mad from that very
cause.’</p>

<p>“‘But how do you account for the fact that there
are three elbows in the left arm and none at all in
the right.’</p>

<p>“‘Dr. Wattles, I am not obliged to account for
eccentricities of formation in different individuals.
I am satisfied with them as nature made them;
and that is enough. It’s none of my business if
Cowdrick had eleven elbows in one arm, and thirty-four
in the other.’</p>

<p>“‘I will not argue the point, sir; but you certainly
have no authority for locating two ribs in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
the neck, and for placing a row of teeth upon the
upper side of the right foot. That foot, Mr. McSorley,
is nothing but a fragment of a lower jawbone,
depend upon it.’</p>

<p>“‘How do you know that the deceased had no
teeth there? You doctors always want to insist
that every man is constructed on the same plan. I
used to know a man in Canada who had four molar
teeth in his ankle; and two of them were plugged.
This appears to be a similar case.’</p>

<p>“‘But you never knew a man who had a thighbone
where his shoulder-blade ought to be, like
this one, did you? You never saw a man with a
knee-cap in the small of his back, either, did you?”</p>

<div id="ip_159" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_160.png" width="418" height="604" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">You never Saw a Man with a Knee-cap in the Small of
his Back.</span>”</div></div>

<p>“‘Maybe I did, and maybe I didn’t. I have no
time to discuss the subject now. The inquest that
I am about to hold will bring out the facts. Mr.
O’Flynn, swear in the jury!’”</p>

<p>The evidence that was given by the witnesses
was of the most varied and entertaining character;
and though much of it was vague and much
was irrelevant, the jury appeared to have no difficulty
in reaching a conclusion, for, after a few minutes’
deliberation, they brought in a verdict that
“the deceased, Henry P. Cowdrick, came to his
death from cause or causes unknown;” and then
they collected their fees and dispersed, with a grateful
consciousness that they had fully discharged
their duty to society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
But, of course, perfectly disinterested persons,
persons who were not in the way of earning jury
fees, were disposed to regard with incredulity the
conclusions reached by the coroner and his friends,
and still it was for the community a vexed question—What
had become of Mr. Cowdrick?</p>

<p>The coroner’s theory, however, was not entirely
forgotten, because Dr. Wattles sent to one of the
daily papers a communication, in which he expressed
his opinion of the bones over which the
inquest was held. This provoked from “An Eminent
Scientist,” who had not seen the bones, a
suggestion of the possibility that they may have
belonged to some mysterious creature who was
the missing link between man and the lower
orders of mammalia.</p>

<p>To this there came a hot response from Father
Tunicle and several other clergymen, who proceeded
to show the monstrous folly and wickedness
of such a supposition, and who demonstrated that
Science and Infidelity, not to say sheer Paganism,
were pretty nearly one and the same thing.</p>

<p>The clerical utterances so excited at least half-a-dozen
other Eminent Scientists that the latter
undertook to demonstrate, through the columns of
the daily papers, that the book of Genesis was written
by Jeremiah; that life first visited this planet
in the shape of star-dust, which, after developing
into jelly-fish, gradually grew to the ape form, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
ultimately became man. They showed how all religion
is priestcraft and superstition; they traced
all the creeds backward to myths built upon the
operations of Nature; they could hardly refrain
from mirth at the notion of a Great First Cause;
and they positively refused to join with the multitude,
for whom, however, they expressed deep compassion,
in believing anything that they could not
see, or feel, or analyze.</p>

<p>It seemed a large controversy to grow out of
Coroner McSorley’s arrangement of the unearthed
bones; but the controversialists manifestly regarded
it as of the very highest importance; although,
when it was ended, each believed precisely what he
had believed before.</p>

<p>At St. Cadmus’s, the Cowdrick tragedy had had,
upon the whole, rather a good effect. The event
was mournful, of course, but it produced some desirable
results. The Tunicle party felt that they
had lost one of their most ardent supporters, and a
contributor upon whose wealth they had depended
greatly for the success of their plans. Thus they
were able more easily to perceive the excellence of
a spirit of concession, and at once they began to
approach the other side with offers of compromise.</p>

<p>Happily, at this juncture, Father Krum received
a “call” to a church in another diocese, and he
accepted it promptly, sending in his resignation of
his position as the assistant minister at St. Cadmus’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Father Tunicle, then, of his own motion,
offered to abandon, as not absolutely essential to
salvation, the use of black book-markers upon
Good Friday; whereupon Mr. Yetts and his adherents
in the vestry declared themselves satisfied,
and once more resumed their accustomed places in
the sanctuary on Sunday.</p>

<p>Upon the second Sunday after the disappearance
of Mr. Cowdrick, Father Tunicle, who held stoutly
to the theory that his late vestryman had been
murdered, resolved to refer indirectly in his remarks
from the pulpit to the bereavement; and
upon his invitation, Mrs. Cowdrick and Leonie attended
the church, heavily veiled, to obtain what
consolation might be possible from the services.</p>

<p>Father Tunicle, being somewhat pressed for
time during the preceding week, had procured
from a dealer in such commodities, at the price of
three dollars, an original sermon addressed to persons
in affliction, and this he brought with him
into the pulpit, wrapped in Leonie’s worked velvet
sermon-cover. The fact that the sermon was nicely
lithographed, so that it closely resembled manuscript,
made it quite impossible for any one to
suspect that it was not the product of Father Tunicle’s
own intellectual effort and of his earnest
sympathy. The discourse was divided into four
parts; three heads, and an affecting application;
which, at three dollars for the whole, of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
amounted to just seventy-five cents a part—not
too much, surely, for so wholesome and comforting
a sermon.</p>

<p>Father Tunicle preached it with much eloquence;
but Mrs. Cowdrick, despite an occasional
sob beneath her veil, managed to restrain her feelings
until Father Tunicle had gotten through with
one dollar and a half’s worth of the sermon, and
had begun upon the third head. Then Mrs. Cowdrick
could stand it no longer. One passionate
outburst of grief followed another, until, when the
attention of the entire congregation was directed to
Mrs. Cowdrick, the sexton came in, and led her in
a fainting condition down the aisle to the door,
where she was placed in the carriage with Leonie,
with nothing to solace her but the reflection that
everybody in the church, including the odious De
Flukes, <em>must</em> have noticed her sealskin sacque and
her lovely diamond earrings.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">MR. WEEMS.—TOM BENNET’S WAY.—MR. GUNN’S
PROPOSAL.—BREACH OF PROMISE.—THE TRIAL.</p></blockquote>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_164.png" width="66" height="68" alt="O" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">One</span> morning, Mr. Julius Weems sat in his
studio, dressed in velvet working jacket
and slouching hat. With palette on
thumb, brush in hand, and pipe in mouth, Mr.
Weems was endeavoring to give a sufficiently aged
appearance to a “Saul and Witch of Endor,” by
Salvator Rosa.</p>

<p>“Hang it,” said Mr. Weems to himself, as he
placed a dab of burnt umber on the withered cheek
of the hag, “everything seems to go wrong! It was
bad enough to have old Cowdrick dupe me in the
way he did; but right on top of that, to hear from
Crook and Gudgem that the Rubens business is
being overdone, and that they have had eight St.
Ethelbertas offered to them during the week, is a
little too much. If the entire profession of artists
is going to turn to painting old masters, I will have
to come down to modern art and poor prices. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the worst luck! There is no chance at all for a man
to earn an honest living!”</p>

<p>Mr. Weems’s soliloquy was interrupted by a
light knocking upon his door. Hastily throwing a
cloth over the picture upon his easel, and turning
two Titians and a Raphael with their faces to the
wall, Mr. Weems opened the door and admitted
the visitor.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” said the intruder. “Don’t
know me, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No.” responded Mr. Weems.</p>

<p>“My name is Gunn; Benjamin P. Gunn.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of you. You are interested in life
assurance, I believe? A canvasser, or something?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was; but I have given that up now.
The business was overdone. I grew tired of it!”</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything, then, about Mr.
Cowdrick’s case? I mean whether he had much on
his life or not?”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, I have heard that he was insured for
fifty thousand or so; I don’t remember the exact
amount. But it makes no difference.”</p>

<p>“Will the widow be likely to get it if he is
dead?”</p>

<p>“In my opinion she will have a mighty slim
chance of collecting anything, even if she can prove
that he is actually deceased. From what I know
of the President of the Widows’ and Orphans’ Mutual
Life Insurance Company, I believe he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
fight the claim through all the courts. That is his
rule. Nearly all the companies do it.”</p>

<p>“What! even if it is a clear case for the policy-holder?”</p>

<p>“Of course! That is the regular thing. They’ll
worry a widow so that she will be glad to compromise
on half the claim, and by the time she has
paid her lawyers most of that is gone.”</p>

<p>“That seems hard!”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is one of the reasons why I quit.
Take the case of Lemuel A. Gerlach, for example.
You remember it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I did my best to persuade that man
to insure. He didn’t want to; but I harried him
into it. I waited on him at his office; I disturbed
him at his meals; I lay in wait for him when he
came home from the club; I followed him to the
sea-shore in summer; when he went yachting I
pursued him with a steam-tug; when he was sick
I got the apothecary to enclose our circulars with
his medicine; I sat next to him in church for four
consecutive Sundays, and slipped mortality tables
into his prayer-book; I rode with him in the same
carriage when he went to funerals, and lectured
him all the way out to the cemetery upon the uncertainty
of human life. Finally, he succumbed.
I knew he would. It was only a question of time.
I took him down to the office; the company’s surgeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
examined him, and said he was the healthiest
man he ever saw—not a flaw in him anywhere.
So he paid his premium and got his policy. Two
months later he died. When Mrs. Gerlach called
to get her money, the President threatened to have
her put out of the office because she denied that
Gerlach’s liver was torpid when he took out his
policy.”</p>

<p>“Did they pay, finally?”</p>

<p>“Pay! not a dollar! The widow sued to recover,
and the company put the surgeon and eight
miscellaneous doctors on the stand to prove that
Gerlach for years had been a complete physical
wreck, with more diseases than most people ever
heard of; and they undertook to show that Gerlach
had devoted the latter part of his life to organizing
a scheme for foisting himself upon the company for
the purpose of swindling it. That was five years
ago. The case is pending in the courts yet, and
the widow has already spent twenty per cent. more
than the face of the policy.”</p>

<p>“It was not a very profitable speculation, certainly.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; it wasn’t. I’ll tell you what, Mr.
Weems, if a man wants to realize on his departed
relatives, that is not the way to do it. Anything
is better than life insurance; even Tom Bennet’s
way.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
“Why, Tom Bennet, you know, is a friend of
mine, who lives out in Arkansas. And one day,
some years ago, a little cemetery in the town in
which he lived was sold out by the sheriff. Tommy
was looking about for a site on which to build a
house for himself, and, as this one happened to suit
him, he bid on it, and got it at a very low figure.
When he began to dig the cellar, Tom found that
the folks who were interred in the place had been
petrified, to a man. Every occupant turned to
solid stone! So Tom, you know, being a practical
kind of man, made up his mind to quarry out the
departed, and to utilize them for building material.”</p>

<p>“Rather unkind, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Tom didn’t appear to think so. And as the
building made progress, he rubbed down Mr. Flaherty
for a door-sill, and had Judge Paterson chipped
off with a chisel into the handsomest hitching-post
that you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Horrible!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Some of the McTurk family were put
into the bow-window, between the sashes, and the
whole of the families of Major Magill and Mr.
Dougherty were worked into the foundation. And
when the roof was going on, Tom Bennet took
General Hidenhooper, and bored a flue through
the crown of his head downward, so as to use him
for a chimney-top. The edifice, when completed,
presented a rather striking appearance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
“What did the surviving relatives have to say?”</p>

<p>“They were indignant, of course; but as the
courts decided that the petrifactions, without
doubt, were part of the real estate, and were included
in the title-deeds, they could do nothing but
remonstrate, and Tom paid no attention to that.”</p>

<p>“Then it is your professional opinion,” said Mr.
Weems, returning to the subject uppermost in his
mind, “that the Insurance Company will not pay,
even if Mr. Cowdrick be found to be dead!”</p>

<p>Mr. Gunn smiled in a peculiar manner, and then,
after a moment’s hesitation, he said: “Really, you
know, Mr. Weems, there is no use of discussing
that contingency. Cowdrick is not dead.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Why, that is the very thing I called to see you
about. I am on the detective force now. Regularly
employed by the police authorities. I know
exactly where Cowdrick is, and I have had him
under surveillance from the very first day that he
left home.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you arrested him, then?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gunn laughed. “Oh, it was not worth
while. I knew I could get him whenever I wanted
him. It never pays to be in a hurry with such
matters.”</p>

<p>“A heavy reward has been offered for him, I
believe,” said Mr. Weems.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” replied Mr. Gunn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p>“Why, the authorities express their anxiety to
catch him, by offering to pay five hundred dollars
to accomplish the feat. Now, the question is, will
Cowdrick’s friends express their wish that he shall
not be caught, by going a little higher, say up to
one thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“But I cannot imagine why you should come to
me with such a proposition. Why don’t you go to
Mrs. Cowdrick?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather deal with a man; a man understands
business so much better. And as you are interested
in Cowdrick’s family, going, as it were, to be
near and dear to him, it struck me that maybe you
might give him a chance to go off quietly upon a
trip to Europe, or somewhere, and save him from a
term of years in jail. How does it strike you?”</p>

<p>“Very unfavorably. In the first place, I have
not enough money for your purpose; and, in the
second place, if I did have it, I should decline to
expend it for the benefit of Mr. Cowdrick.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse to negotiate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, positively.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Detective Gunn, rising,
“I merely wished to ascertain what your views
were. Pardon me for interrupting you. No offence,
I hope? Good morning.” And Mr. Gunn
withdrew, while Weems closed and bolted the door.</p>

<p>The artist had hardly seated himself, and resumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the work of depicting the Witch of Endor,
when another visitor knocked at the door. Mr.
Weems arose, drew the bolt, and opened the door
wide enough to permit him to look out.</p>

<p>“May I come in?” asked Leonie Cowdrick, with
an effort at cheeriness in her voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly. Glad to see you,” replied Mr.
Weems, admitting her. But Mr. Weems did not
look as if he really felt very glad.</p>

<p>“Pardon me for calling, Julius,” she said, “but
I think I must have left my satchel when I was
here last week. I cannot find it anywhere.”</p>

<p>Poor thing! Any excuse would have sufficed to
account for her coming to try to discover why it
was that her lover had not visited her for nearly a
week.</p>

<p>“I do not think it is here,” said Mr. Weems; “I
am sure it is not, or I should have seen it.”</p>

<p>“Then it is lost beyond recovery,” exclaimed
Leonie, sinking into a chair, and fanning herself,
while she looked very hard at the artist, who pretended
to be busy with his picture.</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard anything from your father yet, I
suppose?” said Mr. Weems, after a painful interval
of silence.</p>

<p>“Nothing; absolutely nothing. Poor mother is
nearly distracted. We are in great trouble. And
I thought, Julius, you would have been with us
more during this trial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
“Well,” said Mr. Weems, “you see I have been
so very busy, and I have had so many engagements,
that I could not find time enough to call
very frequently.”</p>

<p>“It looked almost like neglect,” said Leonie,
sadly. “I could hardly bear it.” And she put
her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” said Mr. Weems to himself,
“now there is going to be a scene.”</p>

<p>“Mother said she could hardly believe that you
really loved me,” continued Leonie.</p>

<p>“She said that, did she?” asked Mr. Weems,
somewhat bitterly. “Did she ask you if you
really loved <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>“No, Julius; she knows that I do. You know
it, too.”</p>

<p>“Love,” said the artist, “means faith, trust, fair
play, and candor, among other things, I have always
thought.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Julius?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to be unkind, Leonie; but
do you think that a woman who truly loved a man
would misrepresent her age to him; or that she
would be absolutely silent respecting previous engagements
that she had contracted? How do I
know that you care more for me than you did for
Baxter and the others?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Weems,” exclaimed Leonie, indignantly,
“this is cruel. It is worse,—it is shameful. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
seem to have known all there was to know, without
seeking information from me.”</p>

<p>“That is what made it so very painful,” replied
Mr. Weems, trying to look as if his feelings had
experienced a terrible wrench. “It was dreadful
to learn from outside sources what I should have
heard from your own lips. When a woman pretends
to give me her heart, I expect her to give me
her confidence also.”</p>

<p>“Pretends!” exclaimed Leonie, rising. “Pretends!
What do you mean, sir, by ‘pretends’!
Do you dare to insinuate that I deliberately deceived
you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Weems, calmly, “that is perhaps
a rather violent construction of my language;
but we will not quarrel over phrases.”</p>

<p>“I did not think,” said Leonie, tearfully but
vehemently, “that I should be insulted when I
came here,—insulted in the midst of my grief. It
is unmanly, sir! It is cowardly! It is infamous!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that you take that view of it. I did
not intend to be discourteous, I am sure. Pray
pardon me if I was so. It is clear, however, that,
after what has passed, we can hardly sustain our
former relation to each other.”</p>

<p>“I understand you, sir,” replied Leonie, scornfully;
“I fully realize your meaning. You intended
at the outset to break our engagement. Well, sir,
it is broken. I am glad to break it. I regard you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
with scorn and contempt. Hereafter we shall be
as strangers to each other.”</p>

<p>“I submit to your decision,” returned the artist.
“But—but, of course, you will return my letters?”</p>

<p>Leonie laughed a wild and bitter laugh, and,
gathering up her skirts as if she feared contamination,
she swept haughtily from the room, without
speaking another word.</p>

<p>“That is settled, at any rate!” said Mr. Weems,
as he closed the door. “That is just what I wanted.
I can’t afford to marry poverty. But it is a bad
business about those letters of mine! I wonder if
she intends to use them against me?” And Mr.
Weems, relighting his pipe, sat down in his easy-chair
to make a mental review of the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Weems was not permitted to remain long in
doubt respecting the intentions of Miss Cowdrick.
Upon the very next day he received from Messrs.
Pullock and Shreek, attorneys, formal notice that
Miss Leonie Cowdrick had authorized them to
bring a suit against him for breach of promise of
marriage, the claim for pecuniary damages being
laid at thirty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Weems regarded the proceeding with not a
little alarm; but, upon consulting his lawyer, Mr.
Porter, and detailing to him the conversation between
the artist and Leonie at the time of the rupture,
Mr. Weems was assured that he could make
an excellent defence upon the theory that the lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
had broken the engagement; and he was strongly
advised to permit the case to go to trial.</p>

<p>It did so right speedily; for the attorneys for the
plaintiff secured for it an early place upon the list,
and they manifested a disposition to push the defendant
in the most unmerciful manner permitted
by the law.</p>

<p>When the case was called for trial, Mr. Weems’s
lawyer moved for a postponement; and he pleaded,
argued, fought, and begged for his motion as if the
life of his client and his own happiness were staked
upon a brief delay. As Mr. Weems was quite
ready to proceed, he could not imagine why there
should be such earnest contention respecting this
point. But, of course, it was the regular professional
thing to do. Mr. Weems’s lawyer did not
really want a continuance. He merely cared to
put himself right upon the record by conducting
the performance in the customary manner.</p>

<p>Messrs. Pullock and Shreek, counsel for the
plaintiff, resisted the motion vigorously. When
Mr. Shreek arose to address the court, with regard
to it, the unpractised spectator would have supposed
that the learned counsel was amazed as well
as shocked at the conduct of the defence in asking
that the arm of justice should be stayed, even for a
week, from visiting punishment upon the monster
who was now called to answer for his offences. It
seemed really to grieve Mr. Shreek, to distress and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
hurt him, that the counsel for the defence, a member
of an honorable profession, and a man who,
upon ordinary occasions, had the respect of society
and the confidence of his fellow-creatures, should
so far set at defiance all considerations of propriety,
all sense of what was due to the lovely sufferer who
came here for protection and redress, and all the
demands of justice, honor, and decency, as to try
to keep the hideous facts of this case even for a
time from the attention of an intelligent and sympathetic
jury.</p>

<p>Mr. Shreek, as he brought his remarks to a close,
was so deeply moved by the scandalous nature of
the conduct of counsel for the defence, that Mr.
Weems was disposed to believe that the breach between
them was final and irreparable; but a moment
later, when Judge Winker decided that the trial
must proceed at once, Mr. Weems was surprised to
perceive his lawyer and Mr. Shreek chatting and
laughing together precisely as if Mr. Shreek had
not regarded Mr. Porter’s behavior with mingled
horror and disgust.</p>

<p>In selecting the jurymen, the manifest purpose
of the lawyers upon both sides was to reject every
man of ordinary intelligence, and to prefer the persons
who seemed, from their appearance, least
likely to possess the power of reaching a rational
conclusion upon any given subject. And when the
jury had been obtained, Mr. Weems, looking at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
them, thought that he had never, in all his life, seen
twelve more stupid-looking men.</p>

<p>Leonie Cowdrick came in as the case opened, and
took a seat close by Mr. Pullock. She was dressed
with exquisite taste, and Mr. Weems was really
surprised to perceive that she seemed quite pretty.</p>

<p>Her face was partly covered by a veil, and in her
hand she carried a kerchief, with which occasionally
she gently touched her eyes.</p>

<p>It was clear enough that Mr. Pullock had her in
training for the purpose of producing effects upon
the jury, for whenever during the proceedings anything
of a pathetic nature was developed, Mr. Pullock
signalled her, and at once her handkerchief
went to her face.</p>

<p>The trial endured through two days, and much
of the time was occupied by wrangles, squabbles,
and fierce recriminations between the lawyers, who,
after working themselves into furious passion, and
seeming ready to fall upon each other and tear
each other to pieces, invariably resumed their
friendly intercourse during the recesses, and appeared
ready to forgive and forget all the injuries
of the past.</p>

<p>One of the jurymen was asleep during the larger
portion of the sessions upon both days; two others
paid no attention to the evidence, but persistently
gaped about the court-room, and the remainder
seemed to consider the quarrels between the counsel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
as the only matters of genuine importance in
the case. During the first day Mr. Detective
Gunn came in, and seeing Mr. Weems, went over
to whisper in his ear that Cowdrick had been
arrested, and would reach town upon the morrow.</p>

<p>“We had to take the reward,” said Gunn. “Not
one of his friends would give any more. It’s a
pity for the old man, too! I see well enough now
why <em>you</em> wouldn’t lend a hand.” And Mr. Gunn
looked toward Leonie, and laughed.</p>

<p>When Mr. Porter was not engaged in examining
or cross-examining a witness, he addressed his attention
to the task of getting upon terms of jolly
good-fellowship with the members of the jury who
remained awake. He sat near to the foreman, and
he was continually passing jokes to that official,
with the back of his hand to his mouth—jokes
which the foreman manifestly relished, for he always
sent them further along in the jury-box.</p>

<p>This mirthfulness appeared to have a very depressing
effect upon Mr. Pullock, for whenever he
observed it he assumed a look of deep mournfulness,
as if it distressed him beyond measure that
any one should have an impulse to indulge in levity
in the presence of the unutterable woe which
had made the life of his fair but heart-broken client
simply a condition of hopeless misery. And while
the reckless jurymen laughed, Mr. Pullock would
shake his head sadly, seeming to feel as if Justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
had expanded her wings and fled forever from the
tribunals of man; and then he would nudge the
lovely victim by his side, as a hint for her to hoist
her handkerchief as another signal to the jury that
she was in distress.</p>

<p>But Mr. Porter’s humor, brutal and unfeeling
though it might be, could not be restrained. Particularly
did many of the points in the evidence
offered by the plaintiff impress him ludicrously;
and at times, when Mr. Shreek was developing
what he evidently regarded as a fact of high and
solemn importance, Mr. Porter would wink at the
foreman, and begin to writhe upon his chair in his
efforts to restrain himself from violating the decorum
of the Temple of Justice by bursting into uproarious
laughter.</p>

<p>These rather scandalous attempts to convey to
the jurymen who were awake Mr. Porter’s theory
that the testimony for the prosecution was nonsense
of the most absurd description, and to impress
them with the belief that when Mr. Porter’s
turn came, he would knock it, so to speak, higher
than a kite, provoked Mr. Shreek to such an extent,
that, finally, he stopped short in his examination
of a witness, to snarl out to Mr. <span class="locked">Porter:—</span></p>

<p>“What are you laughing at? I don’t notice anything
in the testimony that is so very funny!”</p>

<p>“The muscles of my face are my own,” rejoined
Mr. Porter, “and I will use them as I please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
“But you have no right to divert the attention
of the jury by your buffoonery!” replied Mr.
Shreek, angrily.</p>

<p>“I will laugh when, and how, and at what I
please,” said Mr. Porter. “I shall not accept any
dictation from you. It’s not my fault if you have
a ridiculous case!”</p>

<p>“I will show you how ridiculous it is before I get
through,” answered Mr. Shreek.</p>

<p>“I know all about it already!” said Mr. Porter.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Shreek proceeded with his examination,
and Mr. Porter laughed almost out loud two
or three times, merely to show the jury that he regarded
Mr. Shreek’s remonstrance with positive
contempt. But it must be confessed that Mr. Porter’s
mirthfulness, in this instance, seemed to lack
heartiness and spontaneity.</p>

<p>But when Mr. Porter’s turn came to address the
jury, his sense of humor had become completely
benumbed, while that of Mr. Shreek had undergone
really abnormal development; for Mr. Porter
could hardly attempt to plunge into pathos, or to
permit his unfettered imagination to take a little
flight, without Mr. Shreek’s humorous susceptibilities
being aroused in such a manner that the closure
of his mouth with his handkerchief alone prevented
him from offending the dignity of the Court.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter’s appeal to the jury in behalf of his
client was based upon his asseveration that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
was the most intelligent jury that he had ever had
the honor of addressing, and upon his solemn
conviction that the jurymen not only represented
accurately the most respectable portion of the
community, but that, as upon this occasion the
jury system itself was upon trial to prove whether
it truly was the bulwark of liberty, that barrier
against injustice and oppression which it was vaunted
to be, so this jury were, it might be said, called
upon to determine whether the system was to retain
the respect and confidence of mankind or to
be branded by public sentiment as a wretched failure,
and to be regarded in the future by all honorable
men with loathing and contempt.</p>

<p>As two of the jurymen happened to be Irishmen,
and one of them was a member of the Odd Fellows’
Society, Mr. Porter did not neglect to allude
to the circumstance that Mr. Weems’s great-grandfather
was born in Ireland; and the learned counsel
took occasion to speak with indignant warmth
of the wrongs that have been endured by Ireland,
and to express his deep sympathy with her unfortunate
and suffering people.</p>

<p>Of the noble aims and splendid achievements of
the Odd Fellows’ Society, it was hardly necessary
for Mr. Porter to speak at length. He could never
hope to command language of sufficient force to
explain his appreciation of the services rendered to
Society by this invaluable organization; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
fact that both he and his client had for years belonged
to the sacred brotherhood, to which they
gave their energies and their devotion, was a sufficient
guarantee of the strength of their affection
for it.</p>

<p>In concluding, Mr. Porter merely desired to direct
the attention of the gentlemen of the jury to
the fact that if designing women were to be permitted
to decoy unsuspecting men into contracts
of marriage merely for the purpose of securing by
artful means repudiation of the contract, so that
the ground would be laid for a demand for money,
then no man was safe, and no one could tell at
what moment he might fall into a snare laid for
him by an unprincipled adventuress. Mr. Porter
then expressed his entire confidence in the intention
of the jury to give a verdict for his client, and
he sat down with a feeling that he had discharged
his duty in an effective manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Shreek, in reply, observed that he should
begin with the assertion that in two particulars
this was one of the most remarkable cases that it
had ever been his fortune to try. In the first place,
he was unable to refer to an occasion, during more
than twenty years’ experience at the bar, when he
had had the honor of addressing a jury so intelligent
and so worthy of being entrusted with interests
of the very highest character as this one was;
and never had he felt so much confidence as he now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
felt when he came before these highly-cultivated,
keenly sagacious, and thoroughly representative
gentlemen to ask for justice, simple justice, for an
unhappy woman. In the second place, while it had
fallen to his lot to witness more than one painful
and repulsive scene, more than one example of the
capacity of human beings for reaching the deepest
depths of degradation, in their efforts to rob Justice
of her own, and to make her very name a by-word
and a reproach among the wise and the good,
he had never yet received so violent a shock as that
which came to him to-day, when, with mortification
and grief, he had heard a member of the bar, sworn
to seek to uphold the sanctity of the law and the
honor of a proud profession, not only misrepresent
the truth most villanously, but so far forget his
manhood as to stoop to insult, to revile, to smite
with a ribald and envenomed tongue, a fair and
noble woman, who already bent beneath an awful
load of domestic sorrow, and whose only fault was
that she had come here to seek redress for an injury
the depth of which no tongue could tell, the
agony of which the imagination of him who has
not fathomed all the mystery of a woman’s love
could never hope to realize. He would only say,
in dismissing this most distressing and humiliating
portion of the subject, that he left the offender to
the punishment of a conscience which, hardened
and seared though it was, still must have in store<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
for him pangs of remorse of which he, Mr. Shreek,
trembled to think.</p>

<p>The learned counsel for the plaintiff asked the
gentlemen of the jury to review with him the facts
of the case, as presented to them by the evidence.</p>

<p>Already they knew something of the trustfulness
and confidence of woman’s nature; their experience
within the sacred privacy of the domestic
circle had taught them that when a woman gave
her affection, she gave it wholly, never doubting,
never suspecting, that the object of it might be
unworthy to wear so priceless a jewel. Such a
creature,—the peerless being of whom the poet had
eloquently said, that Earth was a Desert, Eden was
a Wild, Man was a Savage, until Woman smiled—was
peculiarly exposed to the wiles of artful and
unscrupulous men, who, urged by those Satanic
impulses which appear in some men as unquestionable
proof of the truthfulness of the Scriptural
theory of demoniac possession, should attempt to
gain the prize only to trample it ruthlessly in the
dust.</p>

<p>In this instance the destroyer came to find a
pure and beautiful love, with its tendrils ready to
cling fondly to some dear object. By honeyed
phrases, by whispered vows so soon to be falsified,
by tender glances from eyes which revealed none
of the desperate wickedness of the soul within, by
all the arts and devices employed upon such occasions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
the defendant had persuaded those tendrils to
cling to him, to entwine about him. Artless, unsophisticated,
unlearned in the ways of the sinful
world, the beautiful plaintiff had listened and believed;
and for a few short weeks she was happy
in the fond belief that this reptile who had crawled
across the threshold of her maiden’s heart was a
prince of men, an idol whom she might worship
with unstinted adoration.</p>

<p>But she was soon to be undeceived. Choosing
the moment when her natural defender was absent,
when his coward’s deed could be done without the
infliction of condign punishment from him who
loved this his only child far better than his life, the
defendant, scoffing at the holiest of the emotions,
despising the precious treasure confided to his
keeping, and gloating over the misery inflicted
wantonly and savagely by his too brutal hand, cast
off her love, closed his ears to her sighs, observed
unmoved the anguish of her soul, and flung her
aside, heart-broken and despairing, while he passed
coldly on to seek new hearts to break, new lives to
blast and ruin, new victims to dupe and decoy with
his false tongue and his vile hypocrisy.</p>

<p>In support of his assertions, Mr. Shreek proposed
to read to the jury some of the letters addressed
by the defendant to the plaintiff, while still
he maintained an appearance of fidelity to her;
and the jury would perceive more clearly than ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
the blackness of the infamy which characterized
the defendant’s conduct, when at last he showed
himself in his true colors.</p>

<p>Mr. Shreek then produced a bundle of letters,
which had been placed in evidence; and when he
did so, the newspaper reporters sharpened their
pencils, the somnolent juryman awoke, the judge
laid down his pen to listen. Leonie again wiped
her eyes, and the crowd of spectators made a buzz,
which indicated their expectation that they were
going to hear something of an uncommonly interesting
nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Weems alone seemed wholly sad.</p>

<p>Mr. Shreek would first invite the attention of
the jury to a letter, dated simply “Tuesday morning,”
and signed with the name of the defendant.
It was as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Sweet Rosebud</span>” (laughter from the spectators),—“Before
me lies your darling little letter of yesterday. I
have read it over and over again, and kissed it many times.”
(Merriment in the court-room.) “Why do you wish that you
had wings, that you might fly away and be at rest?” (“No
wonder she wanted wings,” interjected Mr. Shreek.) “Am
I not all you wish?” (“He didn’t seem to be,” said Mr.
Shreek.) “Cannot I make you perfectly happy? Oh, how
I love you, my sweet, pretty, charming Rosebud! You are
all in all to me. I think I can look down the dim vista of
time, and see you going with me hand-in-hand through all
the long and happy years.” (“He was not quite so short-sighted
as he appears to be,” said Mr. Shreek; whereupon
there was general laughter. Even Leonie laughed a little.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
“And now, my own sweet love” (laughter), “I must bid you
good-night. I send you a thousand kisses from your own,
ever constant</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Julius</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Rosebud! gentlemen,” said Mr. Shreek, as he
folded the letter away and took out another.
“Yes, a rosebud, and he the vile canker-worm that
was eating away its life! But this is only one of
many such effusions. Upon another occasion, he
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Birdie</span>,” (general laughter,)—“This morning a
blessing came to me by the hands of the postman, and what
do you think? the writer did not sign her name, and I am
not sure whom I should thank, but I am going to risk thanking
you, my own dear, loving Leonie. Why do you call me
an angel, darling?” (“That,” observed Mr. Shreek, “was
enough to astonish him!” And then everybody laughed
again.) “I am only a plain, prosy man,” (“A close shave to
the truth,” said Mr. Shreek,) “but I am exalted by having
your love. If I were an angel, I would hover over you, my
sweet,” (“And very likely drop something on her,” added
Mr. Shreek,) “and protect you. You ask me if I think of
you often! Think of you, Leonie! I think of nothing
else.” (Laughter.) “You are always in my mind; and if I
keep on loving you more and more, as I am doing, I shall
die with half my love untold.” (Laughter. “Wonderful
how he loved her, wasn’t it?” remarked Mr. Shreek.)
“Again I send you a million kisses” (merriment), “and a
fond good-night, and pleasant dreams.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“Your adoring <span class="in2">J.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Observe,” said Mr. Shreek, taking out still
another letter, “how he mocked her! How hollow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
how infamous all of that sounds, in view of his
subsequent treachery!”</p>

<p>Here Miss Cowdrick bowed her head and wept,
and Mr. Weems looked as if he felt that death at
the stake would be mere pastime in comparison
with this experience.</p>

<p>“We now come,” said Mr. Shreek, “to letter
number three—a document which reveals this
moral monster in even a more hideous light.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Precious One</span>” (great laughter)—“How can I
ever thank you for the trouble you have taken to make me
those lovely slippers? They are two sizes too small for me”
(laughter); “but I can look at them and kiss them” (“He
was a tremendous kisser in his way, you observe,” said the
learned counsel), “and think of you meantime. I could not
come to see you last evening, for I sprained my ankle; but
I looked at your picture and kissed it” (laughter. “At it
again, you see,” said Mr. Shreek); “and I read over your
old letters. There is a knock at my door now, and I must
stop. But I will say, I love you. Oh, how I love you! my
life and my light.</p>

<p class="sigright">
Fondly your own <span class="in2"><span class="smcap">Julius</span>.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>“But,” continued the eloquent counsel for the
plaintiff, “this false lover, this maker of vows that
were as idle as the whispering of the summer
wind, did not always write prose to the unhappy
lady whom he had deceived. Sometimes he breathed
out his bogus affection through the medium of
verse. Sometimes he invoked the sacred Muse to
help him to shatter the heart of this loving and
trustful woman. With the assistance of a rhyming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
dictionary, or perhaps having, with a bold and lawless
hand, filched his sweets from some true poet
who had felt the impulses of a genuine passion, he
wrote and sent to my lovely but unfortunate client
the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Sweetheart, if I could surely choose<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The aptest word in passion’s speech”—<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“That,” said the counsel, “indicates that he
would steal his poetry if he could.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“And all its subtlest meaning use,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With eloquence your soul to teach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, forced by its intensity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweetheart, my love would voiceless be!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">(Laughter.)</p>

<p class="in0">“And heartless, as well as voiceless,” added the
counsel.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Sweetheart, though all the days and hours<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">(Roars of laughter.)</p>

<p>Mr. Shreek declared that he would read no more.
It made his heart sick—professionally, of course—to
peruse these revolting evidences of man’s inhumanity
to lovely woman; of the amazing perfidy
of the plaintiff, Weems. This voiceless lover, who
was not only voiceless, but shameless, feelingless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
and merciless as well, was now before them, arraigned
by that law whose foremost function was
to protect the weak, and to punish those who assail
the helpless. It rests with you, gentlemen, to say
whether the cry for help made to that law by this
desolate woman with the lacerated heart shall be
made in vain. So far as Mr. Shreek was concerned,
he felt perfectly certain that the jury would
award to his client the full amount of damages—a
miserable recompense, at the best—for which she
sued.</p>

<p>The judge’s charge was very long, very dull, and
full of the most formidable words, phrases, and
references. Those who were able to follow it
intelligently, however, perceived that it really
amounted to nothing more than this: If you find
the defendant guilty, it is your duty to bring in
a verdict to that effect; while, upon the other
hand, if you find him not guilty, you are required
to acquit him.</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the evening the jury retired,
and the court waited for the verdict. At six-thirty,
the jury sent to ask that the love-letters might be
given to them; and it was whispered about that
one of the jurymen had obtained the impression,
somehow, that they were written by Miss Cowdrick
to Weems. At a quarter past seven, the jury
wanted to know if they could have cigars; and
Mr. Porter sent them a couple of bundles at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
own expense. At eight, word came out that one
of the jurymen, evidently the slumberer, wanted a
question of fact cleared up: Was the man suing
the woman, or the woman the man? This having
been settled, the court waited until half past eight,
when, amid much excitement, the jury came in, and
disappointed everybody with the announcement
that it was quite impossible for them to agree.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter whispered to Mr. Weems that there
was an Irishman upon that jury whom he felt confident
of from the first.</p>

<p>The judge went over the case again briefly,
but learnedly and vaguely, and sent the jury back.
At nine o’clock the jury came into court a
second time, and presented a verdict of guilty,
imposing damages to the amount of five thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>There was an outburst of applause; Leonie
leaned her head upon the breast of Mr. Pullock,
and wept from mingled feelings of joy and grief.
Mr. Shreek observed to Mr. Porter, that “this is
all we ever expected;” and Mr. Porter said to
Weems that he was lucky to get off so easily; for
he, Porter, had anticipated a much worse result.</p>

<p>Poor Weems alone seemed to regard the verdict
with less than perfect satisfaction; and he
was no better pleased next morning, when Colonel
Hoker’s <i>Crab</i> and all the other papers came out
with reports of the trial in flaring type, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
with the entire batch of love-letters, poetry and
all, in full.</p>

<p>The journals also contained an announcement
that Mr. Cowdrick had been captured and brought
home, and had at once been released upon bail.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">MR. COWDRICK’S RETURN.—MR. WEEMS TAKES A
NEW VIEW OF HIS POSITION.—JUSTICE.</p></blockquote>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_193.png" width="66" height="68" alt="M" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">Mr. Cowdrick</span> again sat in his easy-chair,
in his library, before the sham fire,
and with him sat his wife and daughter.
They were talking of the trial of Mr. Cowdrick,
which was to begin on the morrow.</p>

<p>“It is very disagreeable, of course,” said Mr.
Cowdrick; “but in this life we have to take the
bitter with the sweet.”</p>

<p>“But, oh, papa,” said Leonie, “how dreadful it
will be if the verdict goes against you. Do you
think they would actually send a man of your position
to a horrid prison?”</p>

<p>“Leonie!” exclaimed Mrs. Cowdrick, “I am
surprised at your speaking of such things. Pray
don’t do it again. My nerves will not stand it.”</p>

<p>“You need not be alarmed, my dear child,” said
Mr. Cowdrick, smiling. “My friends have arranged
things comfortably for me with the prosecuting attorney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
and the other authorities. I had an offer
made to me to have the jury packed in my interest,
but I was assured that it was unnecessary, and, besides,
I felt that it would perhaps be wrong for me
to descend to corruption.”</p>

<p>“It is a terrible experience at the best,” said
Mrs. Cowdrick; “but there is some satisfaction in
the reflection that we are not reduced to absolute
poverty.”</p>

<p>“That is my greatest consolation,” rejoined Mr.
Cowdrick. “Pinyard tells me that I may count on
saving at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
from the wreck; invested in good securities, too.”</p>

<p>“Then we can go to a watering-place, next summer,
as usual?” asked Leonie.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>“And can we keep our carriage and our servants,
and everything, just as before?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; there will be no difference.”</p>

<p>Leonie reflected for a moment, and then sighed
heavily.</p>

<p>“And I think very likely,” said Mr. Cowdrick,
“that my poor little girl can have her lover back
again, if she wants him, too.”</p>

<p>“Papa, what do you mean?” asked Leonie.</p>

<p>“Why, I commissioned a man named Gunn, in
whom I have some confidence, to visit Weems, and
to sound him, to ascertain how he felt with regard
to the result of your suit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
“Well?”</p>

<p>“Gunn reports to me that Weems feels repentant;
says he always loved you, and would give
anything to have the past recalled.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Cowdrick, having constructed a sturdy
falsehood, winked at his wife; and Leonie said:</p>

<p>“Well, papa, I don’t know whether I am quite
willing to forgive him, but I confess that I care
more for Julius than for any other person.”</p>

<p>“We shall see what can be done,” remarked Mr.
Cowdrick. “And now you must excuse me. I
have to go to meet my counsel to prepare for the
trial;” and Mr. Cowdrick withdrew.</p>

<p>The interview between Mr. Weems and Mr.
Benjamin P. Gunn, to which Mr. Cowdrick alluded,
was conducted upon a rather different basis from
that indicated by the banker in his conversation
with Leonie.</p>

<p>Mr. Gunn, upon his entrance to the studio of the
artist, began by expressing his regret at the issue
of the breach of promise suit.</p>

<p>“Yes, confound it,” said Mr. Weems; “it is
hard, isn’t it? To think that that old faded flower
of a girl should be smart enough to get the better
of me in such a manner!”</p>

<p>“The damages are heavy too,” said Gunn,
thoughtfully; “and I understand that she is firmly
resolved to compel you to pay the money.”</p>

<p>“That is the worst of it! The mortification was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
bad enough; but five thousand dollars to pay on
top of that! Why, it’s simply awful.”</p>

<p>“The amount would cover the price of a good
many pictures, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and just now the market is so overloaded
with old masters, that they hardly fetch the value
of the canvas they are painted on. A house-painter
makes more money than an artist.”</p>

<p>“It must be a desire for revenge that induces the
lady to be so eager for the money. She is not poor.”</p>

<p>“I guess she is. Old Cowdrick will have to
give up everything, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gunn smiled, and looked wise. Then he
said, Mr. Weems, I’ll let you into a secret if you
will keep it to yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I know,—I don’t merely think,—I
<em>know</em> that Cowdrick is going to come out of this
thing with at least a quarter of a million. He’ll be
just as comfortable as ever.”</p>

<p>“That is nearly incredible.”</p>

<p>“It is the truth, at any rate; and I can prove it.”</p>

<p>“But how about his crimes? He is tolerably
certain to go to prison.”</p>

<p>“What, Cowdrick? Cowdrick go to prison?
Not a bit of it! He is too respectable. That has
all been fixed in advance, unless I am misinformed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Weems reflected in silence for a few moments.
Then Mr. Gunn, rising to go, <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
“It is none of my business, sir, of course; I only
came in to give you the facts because I felt friendly
to you. But if I had my choice between paying
five thousand dollars and compromising with the
plaintiff, I know very well what I would do, particularly
if the plaintiff would rather have the man
than the money. Good morning, Mr. Weems;”
and Mr. Gunn withdrew.</p>

<p>“A quarter of a million!” said Mr. Weems to
himself, as he sat alone, meditating upon the situation.
“What a fool I was. I might have known
that old Cowdrick would take care of himself and
soon get upon his legs again. I believe that man
Gunn was sent here to feel the way for a reconciliation,
and I have half a notion to attempt one.
I’ll make a movement toward it, anyhow. I’ll write
a letter to Cowdrick, and if he gets out of the
clutches of the law I will send it to him, and see if
we can’t make up the quarrel.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Weems went to his desk and penned
the following <span class="locked">epistle:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">Henry P. Cowdrick</span>, Esq.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I write to you with much diffidence and
with deep apprehension as to the result, concerning a matter
in which my happiness is seriously involved. I need not rehearse
the facts concerning my unfortunate differences with
Leonie; but I wish to say that I shall never cease to regret
that a mere lovers’ quarrel, which should have been forgotten
and forgiven a moment afterwards, should have caused, under
the influence of senseless anger, a breach which, I fear, is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
irreparable. For my part, reflection upon my conduct in the
business makes me utterly miserable, for I cannot hide from
myself, and I will not attempt to hide from you, that my affection
for your daughter has lost none of its intensity because
of the occurrences of which I have spoken. I love her
now as fondly as I ever loved her; and though it should be
ordained by fate that we shall never meet again, I shall cherish
her image in my heart until my dying day, and I shall
never cease to breathe earnest petitions for her happiness.</p>

<p>“Believe me,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">Yours very truly,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Julius Weems</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>“That,” said Mr. Weems, “ought to bring him
to terms, if he really means business.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Weems folded the letter, directed it,
and slipped it into his pocket to await the result of
Mr. Cowdrick’s trial.</p>

<p>It would be injudicious to linger over the details
of Mr. Cowdrick’s trial, lest we should have a surfeit
of legal proceedings. Both the prosecution and
the defence were conducted with vigor and ability,
and the jury, after remaining out for a very little
while, found Mr. Cowdrick guilty of sundry crimes
and misdemeanors of a particularly infamous
character.</p>

<p>When the verdict had been presented, a singularly
affecting scene ensued.</p>

<p>Amid a silence that was painful in its intensity,
the prosecuting attorney, hardly able to control his
emotion, rose to move that sentence be passed
upon the prisoner at the bar. In doing so, he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
occasion to remark that the prosecution had no desire
to crush to the earth the unfortunate gentleman
whom it had been compelled, in the performance
of a most unpleasant duty, to arraign before
the tribunal of justice. The lesson that men must
not betray their trusts, and recklessly misuse the
property of others, had been plainly taught by the
conviction. That was the leading purpose of the
prosecution; it was ample fulfilment of the demands
of the law and of society, and it supplied to other
men, especially to the young, a sufficiently solemn
warning against indulgence in extravagance and in
unwise speculation. It would be harsh—perhaps
even cruel—in this instance to inflict a severe penalty,
not alone because of the high social standing
of the prisoner at the bar, but because it was clear
enough that he did not take the money of others
solely for his own benefit, but for the advancement
of enterprises in which others were interested—enterprises
which seemed to him likely to promote
the industrial activity of the country, and to add
largely to the wealth of the nation. With these
remarks, he submitted the whole matter to the discretion
of the Court, earnestly hoping that his
Honor would find it possible to give to the prisoner
an opportunity to retrieve the past by his future
good conduct.</p>

<p>As the prosecuting attorney sat down, the court-room
was bathed in tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
Then the leading counsel for Mr. Cowdrick arose.
It was a moment or two before his feelings would
permit him to command his utterance; and when,
at last, he was able with a broken voice to speak,
he said that he could not find language of sufficient
warmth in which to express his sense of the justice,
the human kindness, the frank generosity of the
prosecuting attorney. These qualities, as here
exhibited, did credit to his head and heart, and entitled
him to the commendation of the wise and the
good. The learned counsel should never for a moment
believe his client to be guilty of that of which
he seemed to have been found technically guilty,
and he could add little to the fitting and eloquent
words that had just been spoken. It had been
written, “Vengeance is Mine,” and it was not for
an earthly tribunal to seek to inflict vengeance.
His client’s errors, if errors they really were, were
of the head, not of the heart; and he was sure that
the Court would never undertake to humiliate this
excellent and worthy man, who, during a long career,
had been an honored citizen of the community,
by even approaching a sentence which might make
him look like a felon. “I need hardly say to your
Honor,” continued the learned counsel, “that to
impose the extreme penalty provided in this case
would not only close the doors of the prison upon
this estimable citizen, but would bring desolation
to a happy home, would break the hearts of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
who are dear to him, and would achieve no good
purpose that has not already been attained.”
Trusting in the clemency of the Court, the learned
counsel sat down, while the court-room echoed the
sobs of the spectators.</p>

<p>The judge, wiping his eyes, and trying hard not
to give way to his feelings, <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Cowdrick will please rise. As you are
aware, Mr. Cowdrick, I have but a single duty to
perform. I must impose the sentence as it is provided
by the law. I remember your social position,
and your former conduct as a worthy member of
society, and I have fully estimated the importance
of the suggestion that your offences were perpetrated
largely for the benefit of others. It gives
me, therefore, great pleasure to find in the statute
a limitation which enables me to inflict a penalty
less severe than, otherwise, I should have been
compelled to inflict. I impose upon you a fine of
five hundred dollars, as provided in the statute, you
to stand committed until the fine is paid.”</p>

<p>As the judge pronounced the sentence, a great
cheer went up. Mr. Cowdrick’s counsel paid the
fine at once, and Mr. Cowdrick, after shaking hands
with the lawyers and receiving the apology of the
prosecuting attorney for pushing him so hard, took
his hat and walked out of the court-room a free and
happy man.</p>

<p>Then a new jury was called to try a book-keeper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
who, because his salary was insufficient for the
support of his family, had stolen three hundred dollars
from his employer.</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney was unable to perceive
anything of a pathetic nature in the case, and when
the jury promptly brought in a verdict of guilty,
the judge, with a perfectly dry eye, sentenced the
prisoner to incarceration at hard labor for ten years.</p>

<p>Although the Goddess of Justice is blindfolded,
she has sometimes a very discriminating sense of
the relative importance of sinners who come to her
for judgment.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_203.png" width="66" height="68" alt="O" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">One</span> of the first of Mr. Cowdrick’s friends
who called to congratulate him upon the
result of the painful ordeal to which he
had been subjected was Father Tunicle.</p>

<p>“It must have been,” said the faithful pastor, “a
terrible strain upon a man of delicate sensibility to
sit there, uncertain what your fate would be. I
sympathize with you heartily, and rejoice that the
end was not worse.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Mr. Cowdrick, smiling.
“Life is full of sorrows and afflictions for all of us;
and of course I cannot expect to escape bearing my
share of them.”</p>

<p>“No; and it is a comfort to reflect that these
troubles are sent to us for our good. I shall expect
you now to be a more efficient worker than ever at
St. Cadmus’s.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Mr. Cowdrick reflectively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
“Possibly it might be better, all things
considered, if I should not resume my official
position in the church.”</p>

<p>“But, really, you must,” answered Father Tunicle.
“You are still a member of the vestry, and
matters will move more smoothly now, for Yetts
has resigned. He was the thorn in my side.”</p>

<p>“Where has Yetts gone?”</p>

<p>“I believe he has taken a pew at St. Sepulchre’s,
which, you know, is extremely Low Church. Poor
Yetts! He has fallen very far! Do you know
that the rector of St. Sepulchre’s positively will not
use a red altar-cloth on martyrs’ days; and that he
walks to church with an umbrella upon the Festival
of St. Swithin,—a positive insult to the memory
of the saint.”</p>

<p>“Incredible!” exclaimed Mr. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“I have it upon good authority. Such practices
do much to hinder the progress of the work of
evangelization.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said Mr. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“And speaking of that work,” continued Father
Tunicle, “I want to obtain a little pecuniary
assistance from you. I have just prepared for
circulation among the depraved poor a little tract
upon the sufferings of St. Blasius of Cappadocia,
but I have not money enough to print it. Can you
help me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. How much do you want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
“Fifty dollars are all that I ought to ask for.
That sum, I think, will enable me to increase the
religious fervor of the poor in my parish to a notable
extent.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick handed the money to the devoted
clergyman, who thereupon withdrew.</p>

<p>Another early caller upon Mr. Cowdrick was an
agent of the Widows’ and Orphans’ Life Assurance
Company, in which the banker held a policy. This
gentleman, representing a corporation which a week
before was preparing to take legal measures to
contest Mrs. Cowdrick’s claim, brought with him
the Company’s last annual statement, and a formidable
array of other documents, with an intent
to persuade Mr. Cowdrick to have his life insured
for an additional twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Upon the second day after Mr. Cowdrick’s
release, also, the De Flukes sent to Mrs. Cowdrick
an invitation to a kettle-drum, together with a note
explaining that a former unfortunate recall of an
invitation was due to the colossal stupidity of a
servant who had since been dismissed.</p>

<p>This very considerate behavior on the part of the
De Flukes had a favorable effect upon Mrs. Cowdrick’s
spirits. She brightened up in a wonderful
manner, and there seemed to be every reason for
believing that her load of sorrow was lifted at last.</p>

<p>Colonel Hoker, writing in the <i>Crab</i> of the trial
and its results, explained to his readers that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
verdict was rather technical than indicative of
intentional wrong-doing, and he congratulated the
community that one of its most enterprising and
valuable citizens had succeeded in escaping from
the toils of complicated financial transactions in
which he had been enveloped by injudicious friends.</p>

<p>Colonel Hoker was disposed to criticise with
some degree of severity Coroner McSorley’s absurd,
not to say wicked, performances with the unearthed
bones; but the violence of the indignation with
which he contemplated the phenomenal stupidity
and the grasping avarice of the coroner, with
respect to the remains in question, was greatly
tempered by the consideration that Coroner McSorley’s
brother was sheriff of the county, with an
advertising patronage estimated by good judges to
amount to not less than fifty thousand dollars a
year.</p>

<p>When Mr. Cowdrick received the note addressed
to him by Mr. Weems, he replied briefly, asking the
artist to call upon him at his residence; and when
Mr. Weems did so, Mr. Cowdrick received him
with gravity, and with some degree of coolness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Weems,” said the banker, “I sent for you
because I wished to discuss with you the matter
referred to in your note. My first impulse was to
take no notice of the communication, for I will not
conceal from you that your treatment of my
daughter had embittered me against you to such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
an extent, that I felt as if I could never forgive you.
But my child’s happiness must be considered before
my own feelings. It is my duty and my privilege
so to consider them; and, to be frank with you, her
sufferings have been so intense within the last few
days, that I have felt myself willing to make almost
any sacrifice in order to alleviate them.”</p>

<p>“Miss Leonie is not ill, I trust?” asked Mr.
Weems, with an admirably simulated look of alarm
upon his countenance.</p>

<p>“Mr. Weems,” said Mr. Cowdrick, seriously, “it
may be injudicious for me to say so to you, because
it will give you an unfair advantage at the outset;
but Leonie has been deeply distressed at your
treatment of her. If I were a sentimental man, I
should say that her heart is breaking. She refuses
food, she is continually downcast and melancholy,
and in her broken sleep she babbles continually of
you.”</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” said Mr. Weems, wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cowdrick and I have been much distressed
because of her condition; but we should have been
at a loss for a remedy if your note had not suggested
one.”</p>

<p>“I have been equally unhappy myself,” said Mr.
Weems. “I wrote because I could find relief for
my feelings in no other manner.”</p>

<p>“Now that you are here,” continued Mr. Cowdrick,
“we might as well have a complete understanding.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Are you prepared to make a proposition
of any kind?”</p>

<p>“I should like to offer a suggestion, if I dared.”</p>

<p>“You have my permission to speak freely; and
I would add, in order to remove any misapprehension,
that Leonie Cowdrick need not seek an
alliance unless she chooses to do so, for her parents
are well able to maintain her in luxury.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Cowdrick,” replied Mr. Weems,
“what I have to say is, that if Leonie can forgive
and forget the past, it will give me the greatest
happiness to renew my engagement with her, and
to return to the conditions that existed before that
miserable quarrel occurred. Do you think she will
consent?”</p>

<p>“Under some pressure from me and from her
mother, I think she will. For my part, I am willing
to overlook what has happened, and to receive
you once more into my family.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick extended his hand, and Mr.
Weems shook it warmly.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Weems,” said Mr. Cowdrick,
“there’s another matter, of which I wish to speak.
I refer to your art. Pardon me for asking you, but
although I shall make some provision for Leonie,
you, of course, must do something also. What is
the condition of your art—in a financial sense, I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, business is a little dull just at this moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
“I thought so. The proportion of old masters
in the market to the purchasing population is too
great. Can’t you take up something else?”</p>

<p>Mr. Weems reflected for a moment upon the
painful lack of opportunities to rob banks with impunity
and profit, and then <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“No; I am afraid not. I am a painter and must
live by painting.”</p>

<p>“Just so; but why not paint pictures that can
be sold readily?”</p>

<p>“There is no money in landscapes, still-life, or
figure-pieces, unless a man has genius. A painter
of ordinary powers has no chance.”</p>

<p>“But why not imitate genius, just as you imitate
the old masters?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Genius is apt to be eccentric. If you make a
show of eccentricity, most persons will accept that
as a sure token of genius. You want to be odd,
novel, peculiar, altogether different from other
people.”</p>

<p>“There may be something in that.”</p>

<p>“Paint a Venus with feet like a fishwoman, and
with a cast in her eye. Paint a Moses with a
moustache and spectacles. Daub off a jet-black
night-scene, in which you can perceive nothing but
absolute, impenetrable gloom, and label it ‘A Meditation
upon Darkness;’ cover a canvas with blots
of white paint, with nothing but the bowsprit of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
ship visible, and call it ‘A Misty Morning in the
Harbor.’ That is the way to provoke criticism
and discussion, to acquire notoriety, and to find
purchasers.”</p>

<p>“It is a good idea,” replied Mr. Weems. “I am
much obliged to you for it; I will accept it, and
act upon it.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to see Leonie before you go?”
asked Mr. Cowdrick.</p>

<p>“If she is willing, I should very much.”</p>

<p>“I will speak to her about it, and prepare her
for the interview,” said Mr. Cowdrick, withdrawing
from the room.</p>

<p>A moment later he returned with Leonie upon
his arm. She had her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>“Leonie,” said Mr. Cowdrick, “this is Julius.
He asks you to forgive him.”</p>

<div id="ip_210" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">

  <div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Then she Flew into his Arms.</span>”</div></div>

<p>Leonie lifted up her head, and the lovers looked
at each other for an instant. Then she flew into
his arms before a word had been spoken by either
of them, and as he clasped her closely, she nestled
her head upon his bosom.</p>

<p>Mr. Weems retained his self-possession so perfectly
during this touching scene that he was conscious
of the fracture of some cigars in his waistcoat
pocket by the presence of Leonie’s shoulder;
but he bore the disaster bravely, without flinching.</p>

<p>Before he released his hold of her, Mrs. Cowdrick
entered the room, and was so much overcome by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the intensity of her emotions when she saw the lovers,
that she dropped upon the sofa, and remained
in a hysterical condition for at least ten minutes,
despite the efforts of Mr. Cowdrick to soothe her.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Cowdrick’s emotion had at last been
brought to some extent under control, Mr. Cowdrick
suggested that it might be as well to fix at
once upon a day for the wedding, so that the two
lovers, after all the sorrows and misunderstandings
that had kept them apart, might enter the perfect
bliss and the sure serenity of wedlock.</p>

<p>Mr. Cowdrick pressed for an early date, and although
Mrs. Cowdrick betrayed new and alarming
hysterical symptoms when her husband expressed
the opinion that all the arrangements might be
made within a week, she finally reconciled herself
to the selection by Leonie of a day exactly three
weeks distant.</p>

<p>Upon the very next morning Mrs. Cowdrick and
Leonie began the work of preparation; and it is
unnecessary to say that while the labor continued,
both of them were in a state of nearly perfect felicity.</p>

<p>If earth is ever to a woman a little heaven here
below, it is when she is called upon to go shopping
upon a large scale with a long purse. The female
mind experiences the purest joy when there are
bonnets to be trimmed, fabrics to be matched,
dresses to be made, underclothing to be stitched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
and frilled, pillow-cases and sheets to be made up,
towels to be fringed and marked, furniture to be
selected, crockery to be purchased, and a general
fitting-out to be undertaken. Mrs. Cowdrick soon
had a dozen sempstresses employed, and every day
she and Leonie, in a frame of exquisite happiness,
made the round of the shops, gathering huge heaps
of parcels. One single touch of alloy came to mitigate
the intensity of their enjoyment. The diamond
merchant and the dealer in sealskin sacques,
having learned from harsh experience the peril of
Mrs. Cowdrick’s enthusiasm for nice things, unkindly
insisted upon making their contributions to
Leonie’s outfit upon a basis of cash in hand before
delivery of the goods. But then we must not expect
to have absolutely pure joy in this world.</p>

<p>Cards for the wedding were sent out at once to
all of the friends of the bride and groom, and of Mr.
and Mrs. Cowdrick. Of course, it can hardly be
expected that the union of two lovers should excite
very tender sympathy among disinterested persons;
but it is rather melancholy to reflect that most of
the individuals who received cards from the Cowdricks
did not accept the compliment with unmixed
satisfaction. The first thought that occurred to
them upon reading the invitation was that they
would be compelled to expend something for wedding
presents, and many of them had a feeling, not
clearly defined, but still strong, that the marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of Cowdrick’s daughter was somehow a mean kind
of an attempt on Cowdrick’s part to levy tribute
upon them.</p>

<p>The presents, however, soon began to come in.
Father Tunicle was heard from among the first.
He sent a sweet little volume of his sermons (the
lithographed discourse not being included among
them). The book had been published at the cost
of a few of the reverend gentleman’s admirers,
whose expectations of the result were rather disappointed
by the sale of no more than thirty-four
copies within two years. Father Tunicle sent the
book to Leonie, with a touching note, requesting
her especial attention to the sermon upon Auricular
Confession, upon page 75. Colonel Hoker, of
the <i>Crab</i>, sent a handsome silver-plated tea-set,
whose value to Leonie was not in any manner decreased
by the circumstance, unknown to her, that
the Colonel had taken it from a former advertiser
in payment for a bad debt. The De Flukes sent a
pair of elegant fish-knives quite large enough to
have served at a dinner where a moderate-sized
whale should follow the soup, and certainly utterly
useless for the dissection and distribution of any
fish of smaller dimensions than a sturgeon. The
Higginses, who were not in very good circumstances,
and who were trying hard to save up
enough money to pay for a fortnight’s visit to the
seaside in the summer, reluctantly sent a cake-basket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
because Mr. Cowdrick had given one to
Maria Higgins the year before, upon the occasion
of her union with Dr. Turmeric. If Mr. Higgins
had ventured, in the note he sent with the gift, to
express his true feelings, the vehemence of his utterance
would have made Leonie’s head swim; but,
happily, he controlled himself.</p>

<p>A perfect outrage was, however, perpetrated by
Mr. John Doubleday, who had lost heavily by the
failure of Mr. Cowdrick’s bank. He positively had
the impudence to enclose to Leonie, with his compliments,
a cheque for one hundred dollars upon the
aforesaid late financial institution. Mr. Cowdrick
said that a man who was capable of doing a thing
of that kind was not fit to live in civilized society.</p>

<p>Mr. Weems’s artist friends all sent pictures,
evidently with an intent that Weems should begin
his married life with the walls of his dwelling covered
with “pot-boilers,” whose unsalable qualities
made them as ineffective in that capacity as they
were in their pretensions to be regarded as works
of art. Weems felt, as he surveyed the collection,
that there must have been among the brethren an
organized conspiracy to unload upon him the
corners of the studios.</p>

<p>Among the other presents received were travelling-cases,
which held nothing that anybody ever
wants upon a journey; cheap spoons put into a case
marked with the name of a first-class silversmith,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
with an intent to create a wrong impression respecting
the quality of the wares; and a host of
trifles, most of them completely useless, and all of
them accounted by the bride and groom as so much
spoil collected under the duress of a custom which
is idiotic when it requires anything that is not a
genuine expression of affection or esteem.</p>

<p>At last, when every indignant friend had sent in
a contribution, when all the dresses were made, the
bonnets constructed, and the frippery and fiddle-faddle
and frills arranged, the day of the wedding
came. It must be described, of course. But why
should an unpractised hand attempt to tell of it,
when there is, within easy reach, the narrative
written by the expert and dexterous fashion reporter
of the <i>Daily Crab</i>? Far better would it be to
transfer bodily to these pages that faithful and
complete description.</p>

<blockquote class="p2">

<p class="center smaller">(<i>From the “Daily Crab.”</i>)</p>

<p class="p1 center larger wspace">A WEDDING IN HIGH LIFE.</p>

<p>“St. Cadmus’s Church, Perkiomen Square, yesterday
was the scene of one of the most brilliant
weddings of the season. For some weeks past the
approaching event has been an absorbing topic of
conversation in fashionable circles, the loveliness
of the bride-elect, the popularity of the fortunate
groom, and the high social standing of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
interested parties having invested the matter with
more than ordinary importance. The bride was
Miss Leonie Cowdrick, only daughter of the well-known
ex-banker and philanthropist, Henry G.
Cowdrick, Esq., and herself one of the leading belles
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon ton</i>. The groom was Julius Weems,
Esq., the artist, a man whose skill as a wielder of
the brush, not less than his qualities of head and
heart, have made him the idol of a large circle of
friends.</p>

<p>“The wedding ceremony was announced for
half-past four in the afternoon; and long before
that hour the streets in the vicinity of St. Cadmus’s
were thronged with equipages belonging to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i>
of our society. None were admitted to the church
but those who were so happy as to possess cards;
the edifice, however, was densely thronged, with the
exception of the pews which were reserved in the
front for the immediate family and near relatives of
the high contracting parties.</p>

<p>“The ushers, who officiated with rare delicacy
and discrimination, were Messrs. Peter B. Thomas,
Arthur McGinn Dabney, G. G. Parker, and Daniel
O’Huff—all of them brother artists of the groom’s,
and men well known in cultivated circles.</p>

<p>“Professor Peddle presided at the organ, and
previous to the arrival of the bridal party he discoursed
most delicious music.</p>

<p>“Among the distinguished persons who graced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the occasion with their presence, we noted the
<span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<p>“Major-Gen. Bung, Colonel Growler, Professor
Boodle, Rev. Dr. Wattles, Judge Potthinkle, Captain
Dingus, Major Doolittle, Hon. John Gigg, M.C.,
Judge Snoozer, of the Supreme Court; Miss Delilah
Hopper (Minnie Myrtle), the famous authoress of
‘The Bride of an Evening,’ ‘A Broken Heart,’ etc.,
etc., Professor Blizzard, State Entomologist; Governor
Tilby, Ex-Governor Raffles, Dr. Borer, U.S.A.;
Rear-Admiral Mizzen, U.S.N.; Senator Smoot,
Signor Portulacca, the Venezuelan Ambassador,
General Curculio, Minister from Nicaragua; General
Whisker, the railroad magnate; Colonel and Mrs.
Grabeau, Dr. Hummer, Thos. G. Witt, Esq., Hon.
John Grubb, Captain Mahoney, of the State Militia;
Professor Smith, of the University; Galusha M.
Budd, President of the Board of Trade; Hon. P.
R. Bixby, Mayor of the City; and many others.</p>

<p>“At precisely five o’clock, Rev. Mr. Tunicle
entered the church in full ecclesiastical vestments,
accompanied by Rev. Dr. Pillsbury, and by Rev.
John A. Stapleton, an uncle of the bride’s. At this
juncture the organ sounded the first notes of the
Coronation March from ‘Il Prophete,’ and the bride
entered upon the arm of her father. Following her
came the groom, with Miss Lillie Whackle, the first
bridesmaid, and these were succeeded by the remainder
of the bridal party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
“The bride was dressed with exquisite taste, in
a white satin costume, which had creamy lace in
jabots down the waist and sides, mingled with pearl
trimmings; while the sleeves coming only to the
elbow, were made entirely of lace. The back was
left quite plain, with waist and skirt in one. Upon
her head she wore a dainty wreath of orange
blossoms, and, of course, the usual veil.</p>

<p>“Among other costumes in the bridal party, we
noticed a Lyons tulle, made up over satin, with
flowing rosettes, and ribbons of white satin for
trimming.</p>

<p>“Attention was directed also to a white tarletan
trimmed with Breton lace and insertions, and
covered with bows and loops and ends of satin
ribbon.</p>

<p>“One of the ladies of the party wore a distinguished
costume of cream-colored satin, with
paniers of Pekin grenadine, with stripes of white
alternating with stripes of cream-color; there was a
satin corsage, plain, like a basque; and across the
front-breadths of the skirt there were soft puffs of
satin and grenadine.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cowdrick, the mother of the bride, appeared
in a regal toilette of black velvet and
diamonds.</p>

<p>“The ceremony was read in a deeply impressive
manner by Rev. Mr. Tunicle, the bride being given
away, of course, by her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
“Mrs. Cowdrick was so strongly affected by the
consciousness that her daughter was being taken
from her, that at the conclusion of the ceremony
she displayed some slight hysterical symptoms,
which for a moment threatened to create confusion.
She became calmer, however, and was led out from
the church by one of the ushers, weeping.</p>

<p>“Professor Peddle then began Mendelssohn’s
Wedding March, and the proud and happy groom,
with his lovely wife upon his arm, turned to lead
the bridal party down the aisle.</p>

<p>“We learn that a magnificent entertainment was
given later in the day at the residence of Mr. Cowdrick,
to his friends, and that the festivities were
prolonged until a late hour. It is understood that
the newly-married couple will spend their honeymoon
at Saratoga.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The reporter was not admitted to the entertainment,
and so there is upon record no description
of it. But we might, if we chose, safely guess at
hot rooms, so crowded that motion was nearly
impossible; at absurd attempts to dance within
narrow spaces; at rows of wall-flowers along the
sides of the rooms; at inane attempts at conversation
between guests who were strangers to each
other; of groups of uncomfortable people trying to
appear as if they felt very happy; of a supper-table
loaded with rich viands for which well-dressed men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
scrambled as if they had been fasting for weeks;
of ices spilled upon costly dresses, and champagne
glasses emptied upon fine coats; and, finally, of
departing guests in the gentlemen’s dressing-rooms,
saying unhandsome things to each other in sneering
whispers of the man whose hospitality they had
accepted.</p>

<p>We can imagine these things; and perhaps if we
could have looked into the house at two o’clock in
the morning when the last guest had said farewell,
we might have heard Mr. Cowdrick say, as he
threw himself weary and worn in an easy-chair,—</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness, Louisa, Leonie is off of
our hands at last!”</p>

<h2 id="AN_OLD_FOGY">AN OLD FOGY.</h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_221.png" width="66" height="68" alt="T" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap q"><span class="firstword">“The</span> good old times! And the old times
<em>were</em> good, my dear; better, much better,
than the times that you live in. I know I
am an old fogy, Nelly,” said Ephraim Batterby,
refilling his pipe, and looking at his granddaughter,
who sat with him in front of the fire, with her head
bending over her sewing; “I know I am an old
fogy, and I glory in it.”</p>

<p>“But you never will be for me, grandpa,” said
Nelly, glancing at him with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, I am for everybody. I am a
man of the past. Everything I ever cared for and
ever loved, excepting you, belongs to the years that
have gone, and my affections belong to those years.
I liked the people of the old time better than I do
those of the new. I loved their simpler ways, the
ways that I knew in my boyhood, threescore and
more years ago. I am sure the world is not so
good as it was then. It is smarter, perhaps; it
knows more, but its wisdom vexes and disgusts
me. I am not certain, my dear, that, if I had my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
way, I would not sweep away, at one stroke, all the
so-called ‘modern conveniences,’ and return to the
ancient methods.”</p>

<p>“They were very slow, grandpa.”</p>

<p>“Yes, slow; and for that I liked them. We go
too fast now; but our speed, I am afraid, is hurrying
us in the wrong direction. We were satisfied
in the old time with what we had. It was good
enough. Are men contented now? No; they
are still improving and improving; still reaching
out for something that will be quicker, or easier, or
cheaper than the things that are. We appear to
have gained much; but really we have gained
nothing. We are not a bit better off now than we
were; not so well off, in my opinion.”</p>

<p>“But, grandpa, you must remember that you
were young then, and perhaps looked at the world
in a more hopeful way than you do now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I allow for that, Nelly, I allow for that; I
don’t deceive myself. My youth does not seem so
very far off that I cannot remember it distinctly.
I judge the time fairly, now in my old age, as I
judge the present time, and my assured opinion is
that it was superior in its ways, its life, and its
people. Its people! Ah, Nelly, my dear, there
were three persons in that past who alone would
consecrate it to me. I am afraid there are not
many women now like your mother and mine, and
like my dear wife, whom you never saw. It seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
to me, my child, that I would willingly live all my
life over again, with its strifes and sorrows, if I
could clasp again the hand of one of those angelic
women, and hear a word from her sweet lips.”</p>

<p>As the old man wiped the gathering moisture
from his eyes, Nelly remained silent, choosing not
to disturb the reverie into which he had fallen.
Presently Ephraim rose abruptly, and said, with
a <span class="locked">smile,—</span></p>

<p>“Come, Nelly dear, I guess it is time to go to
bed. I must be up very early to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“At what hour do you want breakfast, grandpa?”</p>

<p>“Why, too soon for you, you sleepy puss. I
shall breakfast by myself before you are up, or else
I shall breakfast down town. I have a huge cargo
of wheat in from Chicago, and I must arrange to
have it shipped for Liverpool. There is one thing
that remains to me from the old time, and that is
some of the hard work of my youth; but even that
seems a little harder than it used to. So, come
now; to bed! to bed!”</p>

<p>While he was undressing, and long after he had
crept beneath the blankets, Ephraim’s thoughts
wandered back and back through the spent years;
and, as the happiness he had known came freshly
and strongly into his mind, he felt drawn more and
more towards it; until the new and old mingled
together in strange but placid confusion in his
brain, and he fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
When he awoke it was still dark, for the winter
was just begun; but he heard—or did he only
dream that he heard?—a clock in some neighboring
steeple strike <em>six</em>. He knew that he must get
up, for his business upon that day demanded early
attention.</p>

<p>He sat up in bed, yawned, stretched his arms
once or twice, and then, flinging the covering aside,
he leaped to the floor. He fell, and hurt his arm
somewhat. Strange that he should have miscalculated
the distance! The bed seemed more than
twice as high from the floor as it should be. It
was too dark to see distinctly, so he crept to the
bed with extended hands, and felt it. Yes, it was
at least four feet from the floor, and, very oddly, it
had long, slim posts, such as bedsteads used to
have, instead of the low, carved footboard, and the
high, postless headboard, which belonged to the
bedstead upon which he had slept in recent years.
Ephraim resolved to strike a light. He groped his
way to the table, and tried to find the match-box.
It was not there; he could not discover it upon the
bureau either. But he found something else, which
he did not recognize at first, but which a more
careful examination with his fingers told him was a
flint and steel. He was vexed that any one should
play such a trick upon him. How could he ever
succeed in lighting the gas with a flint and steel!</p>

<p>But he resolved to try, and he moved over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
towards the gas-bracket by the bureau. It was not
there! He passed his cold hand over a square
yard of the wall, where the bracket used to be, but
it had vanished. It actually seemed, too, as if
there was no paper on the wall, for the whitewash
scaled off beneath his fingers.</p>

<p>Perplexed and angry, Ephraim was about to replace
the flint and steel upon the bureau, and to
dress in the dark, when his hand encountered a
candlestick. It contained a candle. He determined
to try to light it. He struck the flint upon
the steel at least a dozen times, in the way he remembered
doing so often when he was a boy, but
the sparks refused to catch the tinder. He struck
again and again, until he became really warm with
effort and indignation, and at last he succeeded.</p>

<p>It was only a poor, slim tallow candle, and
Ephraim thought the light was not much better
than the darkness, it was so dim and flickering and
dismal. He was conscious then that the room was
chill, although his body felt so warm; and, for fear
he should catch cold, he thought he would open the
register, and let in some warm air. The register had
disappeared! There, right before him, was a vast
old-fashioned fireplace filled with wood. By what
means the transformation had been effected, he could
not imagine. But he was not greatly displeased.</p>

<p>“I always did like an open wood fire,” he said,
“and now I will have a roaring one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
So he touched the flame of the candle to the
light kindling-wood, and in a moment it was afire.</p>

<p>“I will wash while it is burning up,” said
Ephraim.</p>

<p>He went to the place where he thought he should
find the fixed wash-stand, with hot and cold water
running from the pipes, but he was amazed to find
that it had followed the strange fashion of the room,
and had gone also! There was an old hand-basin,
with a cracked china pitcher, standing upon a
movable wash-stand, but the water in the pitcher
had been turned to solid ice.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of impatience and indignation,
Ephraim placed the pitcher between the
andirons, close to the wood in the chimney-place;
and he did so with smarting eyes, for the flue was
cold, and volumes of smoke were pouring out into
the room. In a few moments he felt that he should
suffocate unless he could get some fresh air, so he
resolved to open the upper sash of the window.</p>

<p>When he got to the window he perceived that
the panes of glass were only a few inches square,
and that the woodwork inclosing them was thrice
thicker and heavier than it had been. He strove
to pull down the upper sash, but the effort was vain;
it would not move. He tried to lift the lower sash;
it went up with difficulty; it seemed to weigh a
hundred pounds; and, when he got it up, it would
not stay. He succeeded, finally, in keeping it open
by placing a chair beneath it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
When the ice in the pitcher was thawed, he
finished his toilette, and then he descended the
stairs. As nobody seemed to be moving in the
house, he resolved to go out and get his breakfast
at a restaurant. He unlocked the front door, and
emerged into the street just as daylight fairly had
begun.</p>

<p>As Ephraim descended the steps in front of his
house, he had a distinct impression that something
was wrong, and he was conscious of a feeling of
irritation; but it seemed to him that his mind, for
some reason, did not operate with its accustomed
precision; and, while he realized the fact of a partial
and very unexpected change of the conditions of
his life, he found that when he tried, in a strangely
feeble way, to grapple with the problem, the solution
eluded him and baffled him.</p>

<p>The force of habit, rather than a very clearly
defined purpose, led him to walk to the corner of
the street, just below his dwelling, and to pause
there, as usual, to await the coming of the horse-car
which should carry him down town. Following a
custom, too, he took from his waistcoat pocket two
or three pennies (which, to his surprise, had swollen
to the uncomfortable dimensions of the old copper
cents), and looked around for the news-boy from
whom he bought, every morning, the daily paper.</p>

<p>The lad, however, was not to be seen; and
Ephraim was somewhat vexed at his absence, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
he was especially anxious upon that morning
to observe the quotations of the Chicago and
Liverpool grain markets, and to ascertain what
steamers were loading at the wharves.</p>

<p>The horse-car was delayed much longer than he
expected, and, while he waited, a man passed by,
dressed oddly, Ephraim noticed, in knee-breeches
and very old-fashioned coat and hat. Ephraim said
to him, <span class="locked">politely,—</span></p>

<p>“Can you tell me, sir, where I can get a morning
paper in this neighborhood? The lad I buy from,
commonly, is not at his post this morning.”</p>

<p>The stranger, stopping, looked at Ephraim with
a queer expression, and presently <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand you; a <em>morning</em>
paper, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one of the morning papers; the <i>Argus</i> or
<i>Commercial</i>—any of them.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir, there is but one newspaper
published in this city. It is the <i>Gazette</i>. It comes
out on Saturday, and this, you know, is only
Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that we have no daily
papers?” exclaimed Ephraim, somewhat angrily.</p>

<p>“<i>Daily</i> papers! Papers published every day!
Why, sir, there is not such a newspaper in the
world, and there never will be.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said Ephraim, turning his back upon
the man in disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
The stranger smiled, and, shaking his head as if
he had serious doubts of Ephraim’s sanity, passed
onward.</p>

<p>“The man is cracked,” said Ephraim, looking
after him. “No daily papers! The fellow has just
come from the interior of Africa, or else he is an
escaped lunatic. It is very queer that car does not
come,” and Ephraim glanced up the street anxiously.
“There is not a car in sight. A fire somewhere, I
suppose. Too bad that I should have lost so much
time. I shall walk down.”</p>

<p>But, as Ephraim stepped into the highway, he
was surprised to find that there were no rails there.
The cobblestone pavement was unbroken.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word! This is the strangest
thing of all. What on earth has become of the
street-cars? I must go afoot, I suppose, if the distance
<em>is</em> great. I am afraid I shall be too late for
business, as it is.”</p>

<p>As he walked onward at a rapid pace, and his
eyes fell upon the buildings along the route, he was
queerly sensible that the city had undergone a
certain process of transformation. It had a familiar
appearance, too. He seemed to know it in its
present aspect, and yet not to know it. The way
was perfectly familiar to him, and he recognized all
the prominent landmarks easily, and still he had
an indefinable feeling that some other city had
stood where this did; that he had known this very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
route under other conditions, and that the later
conditions were those that had passed away, while
those that he now saw belonged to a much earlier
period.</p>

<p>He felt, too, that the change, whatever it was,
had brought a loss with it. The buildings that
lined the street now he thought very ugly. They
were old, misshapen, having pent-roofs with absurdly
high gables, and the shop-windows were
small, dingy, and set with small panes of glass. He
had known it as a handsome street, edged with
noble edifices, and offering to the gaze of the pedestrian
a succession of splendid windows filled with
merchandise of the most brilliant description.</p>

<p>But Ephraim pressed on with a determination to
seek his favorite restaurant, for he began to feel
very hungry. In a little while he reached the corner
where the restaurant should have been, but to
his vexation he saw that the building there was a
coffee-house of mean appearance, in front of which
swung a blurred and faded sign.</p>

<p>He resolved to enter, for he could get a breakfast
here, at least. He pushed through the low
doorway and over the sanded floor into a narrow
sort of box, where a table was spread; and, as he
did so, he had a hazy feeling that this, too, was
something that he was familiar with.</p>

<p>“It must be,” he said, “that my brain is producing
a succession of those sensations that I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
had sometimes before, which persuade the credulous
that we move continually in a circle, and forever
live our lives over again.”</p>

<p>As he took his seat a waiter approached him.</p>

<p>“Give me a bill of fare,” said Ephraim.</p>

<p>“Bill of fare, sir? Have no bill of fare, sir. Never
have them, sir; no coffee-house has them, sir.
Get you up a nice breakfast though, sir.”</p>

<p>“What have you got?”</p>

<p>“Ham, sir; steak, sir; boiled egg, sir; coffee, tea,
muffins. Just in from furrin countries, sir, are you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind where I am from,” said Ephraim,
testily. “Bring me a broiled steak, and egg, and
some muffins and coffee, and bring them quickly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; half a minute, sir. Anything else, sir?”</p>

<p>“Bring me a newspaper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; here it is, sir, the very latest, sir.”</p>

<p>Ephraim took the paper, and glanced at it. It
was the <i>Weekly Gazette</i>, four days old; a little
sheet of yellow-brown paper, poorly printed, containing
some fragments of news, and nothing later
from Europe than November 6, although the <i>Gazette</i>
bore date December 19. So soon as Ephraim
comprehended its worthlessness, he tossed it contemptuously
upon the floor, and waited, almost
sullenly, for his breakfast.</p>

<p>When it came in upon the tray, carried by the
brisk waiter, it looked dainty and tempting enough,
and the fumes that rose from it were so savory that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
he grew into better humor. As it was spread before
him, he perceived that the waiter had given
him a very coarse, two-pronged steel fork.</p>

<p>“Take that away,” said Ephraim, tossing it to
the end of the table; “I want a silver fork.”</p>

<p>“Silver fork, sir! Bless my soul, sir! We haven’t
got any; never heard of such a thing, sir.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of a silver fork, you idiot!”
shouted Ephraim; “why, everybody uses them.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I think not, sir. I’ve lived with first
quality people, sir, and they all use this kind. Never
saw any other kind, sir; didn’t know there was
any. Do they have ’em in furrin parts, sir?”</p>

<p>“Get out!” said Ephraim, savagely. He was
becoming somewhat annoyed and bewildered by the
utter disappearance of so many familiar things.</p>

<p>But the breakfast was good, and he was hungry,
so he fell to with hearty zest, and, although he
found the steel fork clumsy, it did him good service.
At the conclusion of the meal, Ephraim
walked rapidly to his office—the office that he had
occupied for nearly sixty years. As he opened the
door, he expected to find his letters in the box
wherein the postman thrust them twice or thrice
a day. They were not there. The box itself was
gone.</p>

<p>“Too bad! too bad!” exclaimed Ephraim. “Everything
conspires to delay me to-day. I suppose
I must sit here and wait for that lazy letter-carrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
to come, and meantime my business must wait
too.”</p>

<p>With the intent not to lose the time altogether,
Ephraim resolved to write a letter or two. He took
from the drawer a sheet of rough white paper, and
opened his inkstand. He could not find his favorite
steel pen anywhere, and there were no other
pens in the drawer, only a bundle of quills. Ephraim
determined to try to use one of these. He
ruined four, and lost ten minutes before he could
make with his knife a pen good enough to write
with; but with this he finished his letter. Then he
had another hunt for an envelope, but he could find
one nowhere, and nothing was to be done but to fold
the sheet in the fashion that he had known in his
boyhood, and to seal it with sealing-wax. He
burned his fingers badly while performing the last-named
operation.</p>

<p>Still the postman had not arrived, and Ephraim,
being very anxious to mail his letter, resolved to go
out and drop it into the letter-box at the corner of
the street. When he reached the corner, he found
that the letter-box had disappeared as so many
other things had done; so he resolved to push on
to the post-office, where he could leave the letter
and get his morning’s mail. As he approached
what he had supposed was the post-office, he was
dismayed to perceive that another building occupied
the site. The post-office had vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
He turned to a man standing with a crowd which
was observing him, and asked him where the post-office
could be found. Obeying the direction, he
sought the place and found it. Rushing to the
single window, behind which a clerk stood, he
<span class="locked">asked,—</span></p>

<p>“Are there any letters for Ephraim Batterby?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” said the clerk; “there will be no
mail in till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Till to-morrow!” shouted Ephraim. “What is
the matter?”</p>

<p>“The matter! nothing at all. What’s the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>“I am expecting letters from New York and
Chicago. Are both mails delayed?”</p>

<p>“Chicago’s a place I never heard of, and the
mail from New York comes in only three times a
week. It came yesterday, and it will come in
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Three times a week!” exclaimed Ephraim;
“why, it comes four or five times a day, unless I
am very much mistaken.”</p>

<p>The clerk turned to a fellow-clerk behind him
and said in a low tone something at which both
laughed.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose the mails get here four or
five times a day?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p>“Upon the mail trains, of course,” replied Ephraim,
tartly; and then the clerks laughed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
“Well, sir,” said the man at the window, “we
don’t appear to understand each other; but it may
straighten things out if I tell you that the New
York mails come here upon a stage-coach, which
takes twenty-four hours to make the journey, and
which reaches here on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays.”</p>

<p>Ephraim was about to make an angry reply, but
the clerk shut the window and made further discussion
impossible. For a moment Ephraim was
puzzled. He stopped to think what he should do
next, and while he was standing there, he noticed
a curious crowd gathering about him, a crowd
which seemed to regard him with peculiar interest.
And now and then a rude fellow would make facetious
comments upon Ephraim’s dress, at which
some of the vulgar would laugh. Ephraim was
somewhat bewildered, and his confusion became
greater when he observed that all of the bystanders
wore knee-breeches and very ugly high collars and
cravats, in which their chins were completely buried.
Ephraim perceived near to him a gentleman
who held in his hand a newspaper. Encouraged
by his friendly countenance, Ephraim said to <span class="locked">him,—</span></p>

<p>“I am rather confused, sir, by some unexpected
changes that I have found about here this morning,
will you be good enough to give me a little information?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
“I have missed some important letters that I
looked for from New York and the West. I wish
to communicate with my correspondents at once.
Will you please tell me where I can find the telegraph
office?”</p>

<p>“The telegraph office! I don’t understand you,
sir.”</p>

<p>“I wish to send messages to my friends at those
points.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I know of no other way to send them
than through the post-office here.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that there is no telegraph
line from here to New York?”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, what do you mean by a telegraph
line?”</p>

<p>“A telegraph line—a line of wire on which I
can send messages by electricity.”</p>

<p>“I fear something is wrong with you, sir,” said
the gentleman gravely. “No such thing exists.
No such thing can exist.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Ephraim, waxing indignant.
“How do you suppose the afternoon papers to-day
will get the quotations of the Liverpool markets of
to-day? How will the brokers learn to-day the
price of securities at the meeting of the London
Stock Exchange this morning?”</p>

<p>“You are speaking very wildly, sir,” said the
gentleman, stepping close to Ephraim and using a
low tone, while the crowd laughed. “You must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
more careful, or persons will regard you as insane.”</p>

<p>“Insane! Why? Because I tell you, what everybody
knows, that we get cable news from Europe
every day.”</p>

<p>“Cable news! cable news! What does the old
fool mean?” shouted the crowd.</p>

<p>“What do I mean!” exclaimed Ephraim, in a
passion; “I mean that you are a pack of idiots for
pretending to believe that there is no such thing as
a telegraph, and no such thing as a telegraph cable
to Europe.”</p>

<p>The crowd sent up a shout of derisive laughter
and rushed at him as if to hustle him and use him
roughly. The gentleman to whom he had spoken
seized him by the arm and hurried him away.
When they had turned the corner, the man stopped
and said to <span class="locked">Ephraim,—</span></p>

<p>“You appear to be a sane man, although you
speak so strangely. Let me warn you to be more
careful in the future. If you should be taken up as
a madman and consigned to a madhouse, you would
endure terrible suffering, and find it very difficult
to secure release.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> perfectly sane,” said Ephraim, “and I
cannot comprehend why you think what I have said
strange. I wanted my letters, and I wished in
their absence to correspond by telegraph, because
I am expecting a cargo of wheat to-day, which I
am to ship to Liverpool by steamer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
“By steamer! There you go again. Nobody can
know what you mean by ‘steamer.’”</p>

<p>“Steamer! Steamship! A ship that crosses the
ocean by steam, without sails. You know what
that is, certainly?”</p>

<p>“I have heard some talk about a rattle-trap invention
which used steam to make a little boat
paddle about on the river here; but as for crossing
the ocean—well, my dear sir, that is a little too
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous! Why—”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said the man, “I see you are incorrigible;
I must bid you good morning;” and he
bowed politely and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said Ephraim, standing still and
looking after him helplessly. “It’s queer, very
queer. I don’t begin to understand it at all, I am
half inclined to believe that the world has conspired
to make game of me, or else that my poor wits
really are astray. I don’t feel as certain of them as
a clear-headed man should.”</p>

<p>While he spoke, the bells of the city rang out an
alarm of fire with furious clangor, and in a few
moments he saw, dashing past him, an old-fashioned
hand-engine, pulled by a score or two of men who
held a rope. The burning building was not many
hundred yards distant from Ephraim, and he felt an
inclination to see it. When he reached the scene,
men with leathern buckets were pouring water into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the engine, while other men were forcing the
handles up and down, with the result that a thin
stream fell upon the mass of flame.</p>

<p>He had an impulse to ask somebody why the
steam fire-engines were not used, but every one
seemed to be excited and busy, and he remembered
what his friend had said to him about steamers.</p>

<p>So he expressed his disgust for the stupidity of
these people in a few muttered ejaculations; and
then, suddenly, bethought him of his business.</p>

<p>He resolved to go down to the wharf where he
had expected to ship his cargo, and to ascertain
what the situation was there.</p>

<p>As he came near to the place, he saw that it had
changed since he last saw it, but a handsome ship
lay in the dock, and men were carrying bags of
grain aboard of her.</p>

<p>“That must be my cargo,” he said; “but what
on earth do they mean by loading it in that manner,
and upon a sailing vessel?”</p>

<p>He approached the man who seemed to be superintending
the work, and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Is this Ephraim Batterby’s wheat?”</p>

<p>The man looked at him in surprise for a moment,
and then, smiling, <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“No, sir; it is Brown and Martin’s.”</p>

<p>“When did it arrive?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p>“By rail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
“By rail! What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I say, did it come by rail?”</p>

<p>“Well, old man, I haven’t the least idea what
you mean by ‘rail,’ but if you want to know, I’ll
tell you the grain came by canal-boat.”</p>

<p>“From Chicago?”</p>

<p>“Never heard of Chicago. The wheat came
from Pittsburg. What are you asking for, any
way?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m expecting some myself, by rail from
Chicago, and I intend to ship it to Liverpool in a
steamer—that is,” added Ephraim, hesitatingly,
“if I can find one.”</p>

<p>“Chicago! rail! steamer! Old chap, I’m afraid
you’re a little weak in the top story. What do you
mean by Chicago?”</p>

<p>“Chicago! Why, it’s a city three or four hundred
miles west of Pittsburg; a great centre for
the western grain traffic. Certainly you must have
heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, old man, you’re trying to guy
me! I know well enough that the country is a
howling wilderness, three hundred miles beyond
Pittsburg. Grain market! That’s good!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ephraim, somewhat feebly.
“It used to be there. And I expected a cargo of
wheat from Chicago to be here this morning, by
railroad.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a railroad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
“A railroad: iron rails, with cars propelled with
steam! I expected to find an elevator here to put
the grain on board of an iron vessel; to load the
whole twenty thousand bushels to-day; but things
have gone wrong somehow, and I don’t understand
precisely why!”</p>

<p>“Bill,” said the man, turning to a young fellow,
one of his assistants, near him, “trot this poor old
chap up to the mayor’s office, so that he’ll be taken
care of. He’s talking to me about bringing twenty
thousand bushels of wheat on a rail, and loading it
in an iron vessel—an iron vessel, mind you—in
one day! It’s a shame for the old fellow’s relations
to let him wander about alone.”</p>

<p>Before “Bill” had a chance to offer his assistance,
Ephraim, alarmed, and more than ever bewildered,
walked quickly away.</p>

<p>As he gained the street, a man of about middle
age suddenly stopped in front of him, and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Batterby.”</p>

<p>Ephraim had gotten into such a frame of mind,
that he was almost startled at the sound of his
own name.</p>

<p>He looked hard at the stranger, but, although
the features were somewhat familiar, he could not
really recognize the man.</p>

<p>“Don’t know me, Batterby? Impossible! Don’t
know Tony Miller!”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” exclaimed Ephraim; “Tony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Miller! so it is! Tony Miller! Not Tony Miller?
Why—why—why, Miller, I thought you died
thirty years ago!”</p>

<p>“Died! ha, ha! Not a bit of it, man. Why,
it’s absurd! I saw you only two or three weeks
since!”</p>

<p>“Strange, strange!” said Ephraim, almost sadly,
in his mind trying to recall some fragments of the
past. “I could have sworn that you were dead!”</p>

<p>“No, sir; just as hearty and lively as I ever
was. By the way, Mr. Batterby, what has become
of Ephraim? I don’t see him about any more.”</p>

<p>“Ephraim? Ephraim Batterby? Why, who do
you think I am?”</p>

<p>“Joshua Batterby, of course; who else? You
don’t seem very well to-day, I think.”</p>

<p>“He mistakes me for my father,” said Ephraim
to himself. “When will all this wild, puzzling mystery
end?” Then, addressing Miller, he said,
“I would like to have some conversation with you,
Miller; I am strangely confused and upset to-day.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; be glad to have a chat with you. I
say, suppose you come home and dine with me? I
am on my way to dinner now. Will you go?”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” replied Ephraim.</p>

<p>As they walked on, Miller, with intent to break
the silence, <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“I think we shall have rain to-day, Mr. Batterby.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
“Perhaps; it looks like it. What does the signal
service say?”</p>

<p>“What does the <em>what</em> say?”</p>

<p>“The signal service. What are the indications?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea what you mean, Mr.
Batterby.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Ephraim, timidly, “were you not
aware that a bureau in the War Department collects
information which enables it to indicate approaching
conditions of the weather, and that it gives
this information to the newspapers?”</p>

<p>“Never heard of such a thing, Mr. Batterby,
and I don’t believe it. Somebody has been joking
with you. The only weather indications we have are
in the almanacs, and they are not at all reliable.”</p>

<p>The two walked along in silence for a time, and
then Ephraim <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Miller!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I am going to ask you a good many queer
questions to-day, for a private purpose of my own;
will you agree to answer them candidly?”</p>

<p>“If I can.”</p>

<p>“And not to think me insane, or absurd, or
stupid?”</p>

<p>“Of course I should not think so.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Ephraim; “and when we are
done, I may explain why I asked them, and perhaps
you can solve a mystery for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
They reached the house and entered it. The
first thing Miller did was to proceed to the side-board,
fill two glasses with wine from a decanter,
and ask Ephraim to drink.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Ephraim, “I never touch it.”</p>

<p>Miller looked at him for a moment in amazement.
He concluded that this must be one of the
phases of Batterby’s newly-developed queerness.
So he emptied his own glass and put it down.</p>

<p>They entered the parlor to wait for dinner.
Ephraim’s eye was caught by a very pretty miniature
on the wall.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Miller; my wife.”</p>

<p>“Is it a photograph?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what a photograph is.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” sighed Ephraim, “I remember. Let me
ask you something else. Did you ever hear of a
place named Chicago?”</p>

<p>“Never! there is no such place.”</p>

<p>“You know nothing of railroads, or steamships,
or telegraphs?”</p>

<p>“You are talking Greek to me.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a telegraph cable to
Europe?”</p>

<p>“Well, you <em>are</em> asking queer questions, sure
enough. No, I never did.”</p>

<p>“Is there, or is there not, a railway line across
the continent to the Pacific?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
“What a funny kind of an idea! No, there
isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Are there any such things as daily papers?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“One question more: I see you have a wood
fire. Do you never burn coal?”</p>

<p>“Charcoal, sometimes, for some purposes.”</p>

<p>“I mean hard coal—stone coal?”</p>

<p>“There is no such thing in existence, so far as I
know. What are you up to, anyhow? Going to
invent something?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you after awhile, may be,” replied
Ephraim; and then to himself he said, “I am beginning
to catch the meaning of all this experience.
How strange it is!”</p>

<p>A lady entered from the front door, and passed
the parlor. Ephraim saw that she had on a very
narrow dress, with a high waist almost beneath
her armpits, that she wore upon her head an enormous
and hideous green “calash” which bore
some resemblance to a gig-top.</p>

<p>He had not seen one of those wonderful bits of
head-gear for fifty years.</p>

<p>In a few moments the lady entered the parlor.
As Mr. Miller presented Batterby to his wife,
Ephraim was shocked to perceive that she seemed
to have on but a single, thin, white garment, and
that even this appeared to be in immediate danger
of slipping downward. He thought it shockingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
immodest, but he remembered the figures of women
he had seen in the remote past, and thought he
knew what this meant. So he gave no indication
of surprise.</p>

<p>They went to the dining-room. Ephraim was
very careful in conducting his share of the conversation.
Mrs. Miller, unlike her husband, had
not been forewarned. However, once, when she
was lamenting the absence of fruits and vegetables
from the markets in winter, Ephraim incautiously
asked her why she did not use canned goods; and
this opened the way to some vexatious questions.
A little later, Miller began talking about the
Warners, people whom Ephraim in his soul knew
had been dead forty years; and Miller had mentioned
that two of them were down with smallpox.
Thereupon Ephraim asked if the malady
was prevalent, and if Miller had been vaccinated.
And thus again he got into trouble, for neither his
host nor hostess knew his meaning. He was
tripped up again by a reference to sewing-machines;
and, finally, by remarking, innocently,
when Miller observed that it had just begun to
rain, that he was sorry he had not his rubbers
with him.</p>

<p>But he would not try to explain his meaning
when they pressed him. He had, indeed, an
increasing tendency to taciturnity. He shrank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
more and more from the thought of attempting a
discussion of the situation in which some wondrous
mischance had placed him. As Miller waxed
boisterous and lively in his talk, Ephraim was
strongly impelled to complete reserve.</p>

<p>For he had creeping over him, gradually, a
horrible feeling that these people, in whose company
he was lingering, were not real people; that they
were dead, and that by some awful jugglery they
had been summoned forth and compelled to play
over, before him, a travesty of their former lives.</p>

<p>He became gloomy and wretched beneath the
oppression of the thoughts that crowded his brain.
As the hour slipped away, his distress was made
more intense by the conduct of Miller, who, warmed
with wine, mingled oaths with his conversation.
Ephraim felt as if that blasphemy came to him
clothed with a new horror from the region of mystery
beyond the grave. Finally, after Mrs. Miller had
left the room, her husband’s utterance became thick
and harsh, and presently he slipped, drunken and
helpless, beneath the table.</p>

<p>Ephraim sat alone at the board. The room grew
darker, for the rain was now swirling without,
against the window-panes. There was something
ghastly and fearful in the appearance of the apartment.
The outlines of the furniture, seen through
the dusk, were distorted and misshapen. Ephraim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
felt as if he were in the presence of phantoms. He
had the sensations of one who sits in a charnel-house,
and knows that he is the only living thing
among the dead.</p>

<p>His good sense half revolted against the fear
that overspread him; but it seemed not strong
enough to quell the tremulous terror in his soul;
for that grew and grew until it filled him with a
kind of panic. He had such a meaningless dread
as the bravest know when they find themselves
amid darkness and loneliness in a dwelling wherein,
of late, have been pleasant company and merriment
and laughter; wherein has been joyousness that has
suddenly been quenched by utter, dismal silence.</p>

<p>He was seized by a sudden impulse to fly. He
pushed away his chair, and glanced timorously
around him. Then he trod swiftly, and with a
fiercely-beating heart, to the hall-way. Grasping
his hat from the table, he opened the door, and
fled out into the tempest.</p>

<p>As he sped away through the gloomy street, now
wet and slippery, and covered with pools of rain, it
smote his heart with a new fear to think that even
the city about him, with its high walls and impending
roofs, its bricks and stones and uplifting
spires, was unreal to ghastliness. But even his
great dread did not forbid his mind to recall the
mysteries of the day.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said, as he rushed onward, “what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
it all means. This is the Past. Some mighty hand
has swept away the barrier of years, and plunged
me once more into the midst of the life that I knew
in my youth, long ago. And I have loved and
worshipped that past. Blind and foolish man! I
loved it! Ah, how I hate it now! What a miserable,
miserable time it was! How poor and
insufficient life seems under its conditions! How
meanly men crawled about, content with their
littleness and folly, and unconscious of the wisdom
that lay within their reach, ignorant of the vast
and wonderful possibilities that human ingenuity
might compass!”</p>

<p>“There was nothing in that dreary past that I
could love, excepting”—and Ephraim was almost
ready to weep as he thought that the one longing
of his soul could not be realized—“excepting
those who were torn from my arms, my heart, my
home, by the cruel hand of death.”</p>

<p>The excitement, the distress, the anguish, the
wild terror of the day, came back to him with
accumulated force as he hurried along the footway;
and when he reached his own home he was distracted,
unnerved, hysterical.</p>

<p>With eager but uncertain fingers he pushed open
the front door, and went into his sitting-room.
There a fresh shock came to him, for he saw his
wife in the chair she had occupied in the old time,
long, long ago. She arose to greet him, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
saw that her dear face wore the kindly smile he had
known so well, and that had added much to his
sum of happiness in the years that were gone. He
leaped to clasp her in his arms when he heard the
sweet tones of her voice welcoming him; his eyes
filled with tears, and the sobs came, as he <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Ah, my dearest, my dearest! have you, too,
come up from the dead past to meet me? It was
you alone that hallowed it to me. I loved—loved
you—I—”</p>

<p>He felt his utterance choked, the room swam
before him, there was a ringing noise in his ears,
he felt himself falling; then he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>He knew nothing more until he realized that
there was a gentle knocking near to him, as of some
one who demanded admittance at the door. He
roused himself with an effort, and almost mechanically
<span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>He heard a light step, and he opened his eyes.
He was in his own bed-room, the room of the
present, not of the past, and in his own bed. It
was Nelly who knocked at the door; she stood
beside him.</p>

<p>“It is time to get up, grandpa,” she said.</p>

<p>“Wh—where am I? What has happened?”
Then, as his mind realized the truth, he said, “Oh,
Nelly, Nelly, how I have suffered.”</p>

<p>“How, grandpa?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
“I—I—but never mind now, my dear; I will
tell you after awhile. Run down-stairs while I prepare
for breakfast. But, Nelly, let me tell you not
to believe what I said to you about the glories of
the past; it was not true, my child, not true. I have
learned better; I talked to you like a foolish old
man. Thank God, my dear, that you live late in
the world’s history. No man is more unwise or
more ungrateful than he who finds delight in playing
the part of An Old Fogy.”</p>

<h2 id="MAJOR_DUNWOODYS_LEG">MAJOR DUNWOODY’S LEG,<br />

<span class="subhead">AND THE GREAT POTTAWATOMIE CLAIM.</span></h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_252.png" width="66" height="68" alt="A" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword in02">At</span> Gettysburg, on the afternoon of the
third day of July, 1863, Major Henry G.
Dunwoody, of the 483d Regiment of
Pennsylvania Volunteers, while leading his men into
action, was struck by a shell from a Confederate
battery. A moment later he was lying upon the
ground unconscious, and beside him lay his left leg,
severed from his body several inches above the knee.</p>

<p>When the fight was over for the day, the wounded
Major was placed in an ambulance and taken to the
hospital. A day or two later, the fever having left
him, he lay in bed feeling tolerably comfortable.
His mind not unnaturally turned to consideration
of his wound. He began to think how very inconvenient
it would be to have to hop about on one
leg during the remainder of his life, and he couldn’t
help wondering where his leg was and what would
be its fate. He suspected they would bury it; and
the notion seemed an unpleasant one.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the idea of being partially interred,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
he said; “and while I am alive, too. I am too
young a man by half a century to have one foot in
the grave.”</p>

<p>The latter suggestion struck the Major as being
rather a good joke. He resolved to remember it
so that he could tell the surgeon.</p>

<p>The Major could hardly persuade himself, at
times, as he reflected, that he had really lost his
leg. He had a corn upon a certain toe which he
could distinctly feel; there were strong sensations
which indicated that the leg was still there, and he
could hardly resist the impulse to try to lift it in
such a vigorous manner as to kick off the covering
of the bed. But he knew that this was absurd.
While he was thinking about it he suddenly gave a
little start, and a shiver ran through his nerves.
He felt as if his leg had been plunged into some
intensely cold liquid, and before he had quite recovered
from the shock he was conscious of a faint
suggestion of alcohol. Whether the perfume of the
substance had actually greeted his nostrils, or the
alcoholic flavor had been conveyed to his senses in
some other way, he could not exactly define. He
did not try very hard to solve the problem. This
was only one of the many odd experiences of the
first forty-eight hours, and he was too feeble to
make such a vigorous mental effort as was necessary
to their proper solution.</p>

<p>The Major recovered, and was enrolled in the Invalid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Corps. During the succeeding three or four
years he drew his pay, lived an easy life, and devoted
much of his time to experimenting upon artificial
legs of various patterns. He never succeeded
in finding one that suited him exactly, and in the
course of time he collected quite a curious lot of
wooden and cork legs, which he kept standing
about in the corners of his room at his boarding-house
in Washington, and which were perpetually
a source of nervous dread to the chambermaid, who
lived in expectation that some day they would fly
out at her and kick her downstairs.</p>

<p>One day the Major, while strolling along the
street, passed the door of the Army Medical Museum,
an institution into which has been gathered
by the government a very large number of medical
and surgical curiosities taken from the various
battle-fields of the rebellion. It is the most horribly
interesting place in the city of Washington—that
is, to the ordinary lay observer. The surgeons
and doctors, of course, regard its trophies
with gleeful enthusiasm. To others it serves perhaps
a good purpose in suggesting some distinct
notion of the fearful suffering which was the price
paid for the salvation of the Government, and it
may perform a useful office in the future by indicating
to persons who are burning with a desire
for war and glory, that glory is one of the least
obvious fruits of murderous strife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
It occurred to the Major to enter the building;
and for half an hour he wandered about among the
glass cases, studying curiously the strangely distorted
fragments of the poor human body which
are there preserved. As he turned the corner of
one large case, he saw something that induced him
to halt. A brief distance in front of him sat a
woman intently engaged in drawing upon a piece of
pasteboard which stood upon a small easel. It was
so unexpected a sight that the Major could not resist
the impulse to observe her for a moment. She
seemed young and fair; a mass of bright golden
hair fell upon her shoulders, and as she turned her
head to look at something in one of the cases that
she seemed to be sketching, the Major saw that her
profile was exceedingly pretty.</p>

<p>He came a step or two closer, and noticed by
means of a hurried glance that she had a strange
figure of some kind upon the board; and then he
passed on.</p>

<p>Just as he got close to her his artificial leg—a
leg that he had received a few days before by
steamer from France—suddenly launched out
sideways. It encountered the foot of the easel,
and the next instant Major Dunwoody lay sprawling
upon the floor, with the easel across his
back and the pasteboard picture lying upon his
head. He recovered himself promptly, and turning
to the fair artist, who stood above him with a look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
of mingled vexation and amusement upon her
face, <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“I—I—really I am very sorry. It is shocking,
but I assure you I couldn’t help it. I am suffering
from a wound, and—and” (the Major did not like
to confess so openly to his dismemberment); “and
in fact I had not complete control of myself.”</p>

<p>The Major was a handsome man, and either his
appearance, his pleading look, the pathetic tone of
his voice, or all combined, touched the artist’s heart
with sympathy.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” she said, smiling, as the Major
thought, more sweetly than woman ever smiled before.
“No harm is done. I hope you didn’t hurt
yourself.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind. No, I am not hurt; but I
am greatly mortified at the trouble I have caused
you. I hardly know how to express my disgust for
my clumsiness.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not distress yourself about it,” said the
artist, laughing; “the easel is not broken and the
sketch is wholly uninjured. I should not have
mourned if it had been destroyed. It is a mere
study, and very incomplete.”</p>

<p>“You are too generous,” replied the Major; “but
I will take good care not to disturb you again, if I
can find my way out of here. Would you—would
you—be—be—would you be good enough to call
the janitor, or somebody, to help to get me upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
my feet again? I cannot rise without—in fact,
my wound is—is—”</p>

<p>“I shall be more than glad to assist you,” said
the artist, with a glance of pity in her blue eyes,
“if you will take my hand.”</p>

<p>The Major looked at the hand for a moment. It
was extremely pretty; he had an impulse to kiss
it, but he restrained himself. He merely clasped
it in his own. The artist braced herself firmly, and
the next instant the Major stood upright.</p>

<p>“I do not know how I can thank you for your
kindness,” he said, “but permit me to offer you my
card. I have some influence, and if I can ever
serve you in any way I shall greatly rejoice.”</p>

<p>“Major Dunwoody! Indeed!” exclaimed the
artist, as she read the name. “You are not one of
the Dunwoodys of Clarion County, Pennsylvania,
are you?”</p>

<p>“I was born there,” replied the Major with not a
little eagerness. He thought he saw a chance
to acquire better acquaintance with this lovely
and gifted woman. “Do you know any of our
folks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the artist, with a bright smile.
“My mother came from Clarion County. She was
a Hunsicker, a daughter of Hon. John Hunsicker,
who represented the district in the forty-first Congress.
I have often heard her speak of the Dunwoodys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
“Indeed,” replied the Major. “I knew your
grandfather well when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>The conversation need not be given in detail.
The artist and the Major developed at some length
how a Hunsicker married a Dunwoody; how a
Dunwoody eloped with a Moyer, a cousin of the
Hunsickers; how a Dunwoody fought a duel with
another Hunsicker over a political dispute, and
shook hands afterwards; and how the loves and
hates, and bargains and enterprises, and contests
and schemes of the Dunwoodys and Hunsickers
had filled the history of Clarion County for a quarter
of a century past.</p>

<p>At last the Major <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“But you haven’t given me <em>your</em> name yet.”</p>

<p>“Pandora M’Duffy is my name. My mother,
you know, married Senator M’Duffy, state senator.
Poor father died many years ago, and we are now
living in Washington.”</p>

<p>“Studying art, I presume?” asked the Major,
glancing at the easel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Pandora; “I am an artist.”</p>

<p>“Is not this rather—rather a—a queer place
to come to for sketches?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Pandora, laughing; “I came
here to study anatomy for a great picture I am
going to paint. You see what that is?” said she,
lifting the cardboard, and showing the sketch to
the Major.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
“That is a—a—I should say that was a picture
of—well, of the elbow of a stove-pipe.
Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You are not very complimentary,” said Pandora.
“I know it is very raw and unfinished; but
it is at least a fair likeness of that human leg in
the jar of alcohol over there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course! So it is, so it is; astonishing
likeness! How stupid I am! To be sure. The
very image of it.”</p>

<p>“Come now, I know you don’t think so! You
are flattering me!”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. It is wonderful! But—why,
bless my soul, what on earth do you want a picture
of such a thing as that for?”</p>

<p>“For my great painting,” said Pandora, with a
pretty little laugh. “I am preparing a picture,
thirty-eight feet by twenty-seven feet, of George
Washington cutting down his father’s cherry-tree
with his little hatchet.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I expect to sell it to the Government, and to
have it placed among the other historical pictures
in the rotunda of the Capitol.”</p>

<p>“But you are not going to put this leg in the
picture?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I represent George as being barefooted,
and having one trouser-leg rolled up.”</p>

<p>“But then, I don’t exactly see how—well, but
George was a boy, and this is a man’s leg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
“I know, but I am drawing all the figures on a
heroic scale.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Major. Then he added, “But I
must bid you good morning.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to have you come to see
me,” said Pandora.</p>

<p>“I assure you it will give me much pleasure to
do so,” answered the Major, with a feeling of exultation.</p>

<p>Then he bowed politely, and withdrew.</p>

<p>When Pandora reached home, she showed Major
Dunwoody’s card to her mother, and told her of the
adventure at the Museum.</p>

<p>Mrs. M’Duffy sat upon the sofa and listened.
She was a woman of distinguished appearance; of
large frame, not corpulent, but rounded rather more
than positive beauty seemed to require. Having
the carriage of a queen, with a finely-shaped head,
a strongly-defined chin, held well up, an aquiline
nose, and piercing black eyes, Mrs. M’Duffy impressed
the observer with a sense of power. The
mother of the Gracchi might have been such a
woman. If Mrs. M’Duffy had been born to a
throne, she would have left her impress distinctly
upon the history of nations.</p>

<p>Mrs. M’Duffy was familiar with the world. She
was a woman who quickly comprehended possibilities.
She clearly foresaw that Major Dunwoody
might have an influence upon the future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
of Pandora, and the prospect was not pleasing
to her.</p>

<p>“Pandora,” she said, “I trust you did not ask
this man to call?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, mother.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear it. I never liked <em>his</em> branch
of the Dunwoodys. His father was mixed up
with some very suspicious land speculations, and
he died insolvent. Major Dunwoody has nothing
but his pay. You must treat him with coolness
when he comes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why! Why, because it is very necessary that
you should give him no encouragement of any
kind. He is not a desirable match for you. Besides,
you owe it to your family now to offer every
opportunity to Achilles Smith. Mr. Smith worships
you!”</p>

<p>“And I hate him,” said Pandora, vigorously.</p>

<p>“Hate him, my child? Why, how absurd!
Mr. Smith is a very charming man, and when he
gets his Pottawatomie claim through Congress, he
will be rich.”</p>

<p>“He will never get it through; and I won’t
have him, if he does!”</p>

<p>“Never get it through, Pandora! Didn’t General
Belcher, the member for the ninety-sixth
Kansas district, and his bosom friend, assure me
positively that it would be approved during the
present session?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
“His claim is ridiculous. Congress will never
allow it.”</p>

<p>“My dear! Pray don’t be absurd! His claim
is quite as reasonable as thousands of similar
claims. The Pottawatomie Indians scalped him in
1862, and he very properly asks the legislature of
his country to compel the savages to make reparation
by surrendering two million acres of their
reservation. I cannot see anything ridiculous
about that. If he succeeds, he will be the largest
individual land-owner in the West.”</p>

<p>“If he succeeds!”</p>

<p>“But General Belcher, who is pushing his case
in Congress, and who is to share the property with
him, positively declares that he will succeed. The
General, also, makes your acceptance of Achilles
the condition of his championship of your picture.
He says that Congress shall buy that picture upon
the day that you marry Achilles Smith!”</p>

<p>“General Belcher is simply disgusting, mother.
I would never think of accepting a favor from
him.”</p>

<p>“Not when his exertions can lift you and your
mother out of poverty, Pandora? You talk most
unreasonably.”</p>

<p>“I mean what I say,” said Pandora firmly.</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss, we shall see,” replied Mrs.
M’Duffy, rising and sweeping majestically from
the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
Major Dunwoody called upon that very evening.
He called again the next evening. He called frequently
upon following evenings; and although
Mrs. M’Duffy treated him with coldness which
bordered upon disdain, the Major’s infatuation for
Pandora was so strong that he forgot Mrs. M’Duffy’s
incivility in rejoicing over the exceeding graciousness
of her daughter.</p>

<p>The Major was convinced that Pandora loved
him, but he hesitated to take practical measures
to ascertain the fact, because he could not summon
up a sufficient amount of resolution to tell
her the truth about the loss of his leg. He was
far too honorable to deceive her respecting his
misfortune until she had committed herself to
him, and he was haunted by apprehension that she
might reject him when she knew the actual state
of the case. A catastrophe brought matters to
a crisis.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening the Major escorted Pandora
to church. During the worship the Major felt
his French leg give several very strange twitches,
and he could hear a clicking sound in the knee as
if some of the springs were loose and moving about
in an independent manner. Pandora noticed the
noise too, and leaned over to ask the Major, in a
whisper, if there was not a mouse running about
upon the floor of the pew. The Major said he did
not think there was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Pandora whispered that it sounded rather more
like machinery.</p>

<p>The Major faintly intimated that it might proceed
from the gas meter in the cellar, or perhaps
the people in the gallery were fixing something
about the organ.</p>

<p>The Major had always rather doubted the springs
in the knee-joint of the French leg. They impressed
him as being far more complicated and ingenious
than was necessary for simple purposes of
locomotion. He was thinking about them tremulously
when the sermon began. The preacher had
hardly announced his text when the Major’s leg
suddenly flew up, kicked the bonnet upon the
head of the lady in front of him over the wearer’s
eyes, and finally the leg fell upon the top of the
back of the pew, where it kicked away vigorously.
The Major, blushing crimson, grasped it and pulled
it down by a severe effort. The wearer of the
bonnet looked at him with indignation. Pandora
seemed ready to faint.</p>

<p>When the Major let go his hold of the leg it
bounced up again, and performed the most eccentric
movements upon the back of the pew. Pandora
could not suppress a faint scream; and the
entire congregation stared at the miserable Major
as he seized the leg and thrust it down into the
pew. He held it down firmly, but the springs
were strong, and they forced the toes to beat a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
wild tattoo upon the wooden partition in front of
them.</p>

<p>In an agony of mortification, the Major rose,
with the intention to leave the building. The sexton,
who had approached him to ascertain the
cause of the disturbance, gave him his arm, and
the Major hopped down the aisle with his horrible
leg flying out behind and before in a convulsive
manner, kicking the sexton, banging pew-doors,
and behaving generally in a most sensational and
exciting manner.</p>

<p>Pandora followed her lover at a short distance.
When the porch of the church was reached, the
leg was still in a condition of violent agitation, and
the Major, wild with shame and rage, said to the
<span class="locked">sexton,—</span></p>

<p>“Take it off! Unbuckle it! Take it off quick!”</p>

<p>The sexton bravely approached, fumbled about
for a moment in search of the strap, and an instant
later the Major’s imported leg lay upon the carpet
squirming about, kicking viciously, and leaping
hither and thither like a wounded and desperate
animal.</p>

<p>“Call a carriage,” gasped the Major, as he leaned
against the wall.</p>

<p>The sexton dispatched a boy for a vehicle, and
when it came he placed the Major within, helped
Pandora to a seat, and the party moved toward
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
For a little while neither the Major nor Pandora
spoke. The situation seemed too awful for words.
The silence was becoming embarrassing, when suddenly
Pandora <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Poor man!”</p>

<p>“What, are you sorry for me?” asked the Major
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am. How you must have suffered!”</p>

<p>“I thought you would hate me for subjecting
you to such mortification.”</p>

<p>“But you couldn’t help it. I would be very
unjust to blame you.”</p>

<p>“And you do not dislike me because I am so
crippled?”</p>

<p>“How could I? You are a soldier. You lost
your leg honorably, did you not?”</p>

<p>“It was shot away at Gettysburg.”</p>

<p>“You lost it to save my country, and you think
I would not honor you for such a sacrifice?”</p>

<p>“Your kind words make me brave. If I might
dare—”</p>

<p>“Such a hero as you may dare anything,” she
said.</p>

<p>“May I dare to ask if, while you honor me, you
can also love me?”</p>

<p>“You may; and if you do, I will answer ‘Yes.’”</p>

<p>“You are an angel!” exclaimed the Major.</p>

<p>They expressed their emotion in a very usual
manner, which need not be described. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
carriage turned into the street upon which Pandora
lived, she <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Henry dear,—I may call you <em>Henry</em>, mayn’t
I?—where <em>is</em> your leg?”</p>

<p>“I left it squirming about in the church porch.”</p>

<p>“No; I mean your real one, dear. The leg that
was shot off.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea. Buried, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Pandora was silent and thoughtful for a moment.
Then she <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it barely possible that one of those legs
preserved at the Medical Museum is yours?”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare I never thought of that! Perhaps
mine <em>is</em> there.”</p>

<p>“The one I was sketching on the day I first met
you was labelled—‘Gettysburg, July 3rd, 1863.’
Maybe that was it.”</p>

<p>“I will go around to-morrow and examine it. It
would be very odd, Pandora dearest, if it should be
mine. Wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Very. But I want you to make me a promise.
If it should be yours, will you get it and give it to
me?”</p>

<p>“If I can I will. But what on earth do you
want it for?”</p>

<p>“For two reasons I want it: first, because if I am
to marry you I have a legal right to all of you; and,
second, because my George Washington has been
standing upon one leg beside the cherry-tree for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
three weeks now, for the reason that I can’t make
a satisfactory study of his other leg.”</p>

<p>“Pandora, I will gratify you if human energy is
equal to the task. The impulses of an undying
affection, not less than a fervid regard for the
interests of high art, shall nerve me to the work.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, darling!” she said.</p>

<p>Then the carriage stopped at the M’Duffy front
door. Pandora alighted, rang the bell, kissed her
hand and disappeared, while the Major drove home
in ecstasy to brood upon his unexpected happiness,
and to fit himself with a Government leg that was
numbered among the best in his collection.</p>

<p>The next morning he went around to the Medical
Museum and examined Exhibit 1307 in Case 25,
being the leg which Pandora had proposed to pass
on to immortality by attaching a representation of it
to her picture of George Washington.</p>

<p>The Major could not say with positiveness that
the leg was his, but his impression that it belonged to
him was strengthened by certain scars that seemed
to be familiar, among them one which called up
memories of a dog-bite obtained in a Clarion
County orchard away back in the years of his
boyhood.</p>

<p>A thought struck him. He called the janitor,
and slipping a coin into his hand, he explained the
case to that officer. At the Major’s suggestion the
janitor removed the specimen from the alcohol,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
and trod heavily upon the excrescence upon the
toe. The Major yelled with pain. The identity of
the limb was definitely ascertained.</p>

<p>“I will recover possession of that leg,” said the
Major as he left the building, “if I have to buy the
entire collection!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_270.png" width="66" height="68" alt="G" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword in02">General</span> William Henry Harrison Belcher,
member of Congress from the ninety-sixth
Kansas district, sat in his room at
his hotel one evening, with his feet upon the table,
a cigar in his mouth, and a glass containing a
mysterious liquid preparation beside him.</p>

<p>In appearance the General was a man of mark.
His thick gray hair covered a noble head; his nose
was large and curved in bold lines indicating
strength; his face was closely shaven and rather
inclined to pallor. He had eyes that seemed to
pierce the person upon whom they rested, and
when he used his feet to stand upon, instead of
devoting them to purely ornamental purposes, as
at present, his figure appeared tall and slender and
comely. Those who did not know the General
imagined, when they saw him in the Capitol, that
he was some distinguished statesman upon whom
rested the weight of a nation’s business. Those
who knew him, on the contrary, were aware that he
was a man of no education, no skill in higher
politics, and no principles worth mentioning. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
had begun life as a mule-driver on the plains, but
one day he contrived to obtain a contract for
supplying a certain Indian agency with cattle. The
Government paid him for fat steers, and he furnished
the oldest and leanest cows he could find west of
the Mississippi, and when they were weighed in
pairs, he and his drover stood on the scale each
time so as to bring the aggregate weight up to a
comfortable figure. He made a small fortune at
this business, and then he bought his way into the
Legislature, and subsequently into Congress, his
purpose being not so much to give his suffering
country the benefit of his skill as a legislator, as to
open for himself larger opportunities to acquire
wealth at his country’s expense. He had succeeded
in several enterprises of the kind which had engaged
his attention since he came to Washington, and now
he was devoting attention to his great scheme for
seizing the Pottawatomie Reservation as a matter
of retributive justice to its savage owners. As he
sat in his room, thinking upon the subject, he heard
a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” said the General.</p>

<p>Achilles Smith entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, Kill!” said the General, still keeping his
feet upon the table. “Take a chair.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith sat down.</p>

<p>“What’ll you have?” asked the General.</p>

<p>“Cocktail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
“Mix one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith prepared the beverage, placed himself
swiftly outside of it, elevated his feet until they
rested close to those of the General, and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Well, how does the old thing work?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty well! tolerable! The Committee
have promised to consider your case to-morrow,
and I want you to be on hand, ready to tell your
story. You’ve got it straight, I reckon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it by heart.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see. Your theory is that you were
scalped by a Pottawatomie Indian in 1862. Now,
where is that scalp?”</p>

<p>“In my trunk. Between ourselves, you know,
I bought it of an Indian in Laramie year before
last.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now, what is the name of the
Indian who scalped you?”</p>

<p>“Jumping Antelope, a chief.”</p>

<p>“Under what circumstances?”</p>

<p>“I was trying to convert him by reading the
Scriptures to him.”</p>

<p>“See here, Kill, isn’t that a little thin? He
couldn’t understand the language, you know. I’m
afraid that won’t wash.”</p>

<p>“I translated it as I went along.”</p>

<p>“S’pos’n’ the Committee ask you to prove that
you know the language?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get off some gibberish, and you can assure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
them that you recognize it as pure Pottawatomie.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now, what particular part of the—the—Scriptures
were you reading to him?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. Let’s see; what are some of the
books?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me; I’m not very well posted. We
used to have a Bible out in the Kansas Legislature,
to swear members on, but they always kept a
string tied around it, and after it was stolen a rumor
got around that the clerk swore a whole House
of Representatives in on Kidderminster’s Digest
of the State Laws.”</p>

<p>“Jonah’s the only book I recall very distinctly
now.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, if you can remember something in
it. I connect it indistinctly with reminiscences of
a whale.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, I was trying to convert that Indian
by reading to him about Jonah and the whale,
when he rose up suddenly and began fumbling
about my hair with a carving-knife.”</p>

<p>“The Committee may go into detail. Now,
why did he do this? Is the narrative calculated
in any way to excite the nervous system of an untutored
child of the forest?”</p>

<p>“No-no-no!”</p>

<p>“Nothing in it about depriving persons of their
hair? Don’t say Jonah was scalped, hey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
“No.”</p>

<p>“Did your assailant accompany the act with any
conversation?”</p>

<p>“He merely remarked ‘How!’ and I thought I
caught some rather indistinct reference to the
Happy Hunting Grounds; but I’ll only swear to
‘How.’”</p>

<p>“‘How!’ They always say that. It indicates
almost anything, from ferocious animosity to a
desire to borrow plug tobacco. Then he took
your hair, did he?”</p>

<p>“Sawed it right out, and would have murdered
me if I had not fled.”</p>

<p>“You dropped the Bible when you ran?”</p>

<p>“Yes, after snatching my scalp from his hand.”</p>

<p>“Well, Kill, I think maybe that yarn’ll pass.
It’s not first-rate, but there are three men in the
Committee who want my vote for claims of theirs,
and I have an idea they’ll back us through thick
and thin. My boy, don’t call me a prophet if we
don’t snatch that Reservation before the session’s
out. It looks to me like a sure thing.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be as sure of something else I’m
after,” said Smith, rather sadly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The M’Duffy girl.”</p>

<p>“You shall have her, Kill, you shall have her.
The old lady has promised me, positively.”</p>

<p>“I thought so myself at first, but there is another
man in the way now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a one-legged army man. She’s taken a
fancy to him, her mother tells me. He has a leg
up here in the Medical Museum, and she fell in
love with that first and it spread to the rest of him
afterwards, gradually.”</p>

<p>“That’s original, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Wants to paint that preserved leg in her picture.
Going to dovetail it on to Washington. If
he can get the leg out of the Museum she promises
to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>I’ll</em> put a stop to <em>that</em>. I’ll introduce a
bill forfeiting to the Government for ever all the
odd legs in the Museum. Kill, you mind what I
tell you, and Pandora shall make <em>you</em> her model instead
of this military ruin who is sparking her.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to feel certain of that.”</p>

<p>“You may; depend on me. A man with my
war record needn’t fear to offer himself to any—what
is this fellow? Major, hey?—Well, I’ll
risk offending any major in the service.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had any war record.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I a General?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know, but you can’t throw a brick in the
street without mowing down a couple of Generals—peace
men from principle.”</p>

<p>“But I have seen war, my boy! I was in the
army, only as a Captain, I admit. But I smelt
powder. Kill, I was distinguished for one thing:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
other officers always lost their men, but I never
had a fight that I didn’t bring out one-third more
men than I took in.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have been promoted. Was it
your war record that took you to Congress?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; it was brains—pure intellect—that
did that. You know my district? Not a railroad in
it. Not enough business to pay for the grease on
the engines if there was a railroad. Of course,
under such circumstances, the one thing all the
people want worse than anything else is a railroad.
People always want what they can’t get.”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“So as soon as I was nominated I hired four
hundred men, divided them into squads, fitted
them out with rods and chains and theodolites and
other surveying apparatus, and started them all
over the district, pretending to run lines. A squad
would burst into a man’s potato-patch and go to
work. The owner would rush out and say, ‘What
in thunder you fellows a-doin’ in that potato-patch?’
And they’d say, ‘We’re surveying the route for
old Belcher’s railroad.’ Then the man would fly
into the house and tell his wife that Belcher was
going to run a railroad through his property, and
they’d go wild with joy. Kill, I carried that district
by fifteen hundred majority over a man who
under other circumstances would have beaten me
out of my boots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
“That was genius, sir! nothing but pure genius.”</p>

<p>“I think so; genius for statesmanship; not such
statesmanship as they have in the played-out despotisms
of Europe, but the kind that is needed in a
new country.”</p>

<p>“I say, Belcher, how would it do for you and me
to go around and call on old Mrs. M’Duffy? I’ve a
notion to go.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing. Maybe we can settle the case of
that dilapidated Major.”</p>

<p>Mrs. M’Duffy was at home when the General
and Mr. Smith called, and she received them with
much cordiality.</p>

<p>The conversation naturally turned at an early
moment to the subject of Smith’s claim.</p>

<p>“By the way, Mr. Smith,” said Mrs. M’Duffy,
“your claim rests, I think you said, upon the fact
that you were scalped? Your head has not that appearance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! You see, madam, that in the lapse of
years the wound has healed; a new scalp has gradually
formed, so that now I appear to be merely
bald. I have the original scalp at home in my
trunk.”</p>

<p>“How very interesting. Were you ever scalped,
General?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, never. My custom has been to
take scalps, not to lose them.”</p>

<p>“The General is an old Indian fighter,” observed
Achilles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
“I was not aware of the fact,” said Mrs. M’Duffy.
“You are familiar therefore with the plains. Did
you ever visit the Pottawatomie Reservation—Mr.
Smith’s prospective property?”</p>

<p>“Frequently, ma’am. It’s the handsomest tract
of ground east of the Rocky Mountains.”</p>

<p>“You propose to live on it, when you get it, do
you not, Mr. Smith?”</p>

<p>“On part of it. Half goes to the General; then
I shall reserve 5000 acres for myself and dispose of
the remainder to settlers. If I am successful in
my suit with your daughter I shall build a house in
the centre of my 5000 acres, and we will live there.
We shall have plenty of elbow-room. She can
paint pictures as big as all out-of-doors, and bigger.”</p>

<p>“Pandora is <em>so</em> fond of the open country.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, she can get half a dozen squaws
to do her housework, so that she can have all her
time to herself. I am going to arrange it so that
she can shoot grizzly bears from the parlor window,
if she wants to; and as for wardrobe!—well, I
intend to buy all our clothes in New York, and
they’ll be of a kind that’ll cause every woman on
the old Pottawatomie Reservation to turn green
with envy.”</p>

<p>“Pandora ought to appreciate your kindness,”
said Mrs. M’Duffy; “but she is a strange girl, and,
I fear, thinks more of her art than of the matters
that commonly engage a young girl’s attention.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
“By the way, ma’am, how is the great picture
coming on?”</p>

<p>“Slowly. Pandora made the handle of the
hatchet more than twice as thick as the tree, and
she had to alter it. A connoisseur, a friend of hers,
also pointed out to her that in fore-shortening
Washington’s right leg she had made his foot appear
to be resting upon a mountain upon the other
side of the river. Corrections of this kind require
time.”</p>

<p>“She must hurry up, ma’am; she must hurry
up,” said the General; “I have everything fixed to
obtain the consent of Congress to its purchase by
the Government. I am going to press the resolution
as soon as I hear that she has accepted
Smith.”</p>

<p>“You are <em>too</em> kind. Do you think it is likely to
be favorably received? Mrs. Easby told me yesterday
that Judge Cudderbury said that if George
Washington could have foreseen Pandora’s picture
he would have had incorporated into the Constitution
of the United States a section making it a felony
to represent him as within a thousand miles of
a cherry-tree. But then the judge, you know, has
a daughter who professes to be an artist.”</p>

<p>“Jealousy, ma’am! sheer jealousy. The judge
knows no more about art, anyhow, than a Colorado
mule knows about the sidereal system. Now, <em>my</em>
opinion, Mrs. M’Duffy, is, that old Michael-what’s-his-name,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
over there in Rome, couldn’t hold a candle
to your daughter in the matter of covering
canvas.”</p>

<p>As the General was speaking, the door opened,
and Pandora entered. She spoke politely, but
coldly, to the visitors, and after the passage of a
few remarks about the condition of the weather, the
General withdrew, Mrs. M’Duffy followed him to
the hall to bid him adieu, and Mr. Smith remained
with Pandora.</p>

<p>It occurred to Achilles that if Mrs. M’Duffy
should happen to fail to return this would be an uncommonly
good opportunity to speak of the state
of his feelings. The thought pleased him, but it
gave him some embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Miss Pandora,” he said, “I am glad to hear that
you are succeeding so nicely with your picture.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; it <em>is</em> making some progress. I
have been delayed by a few trifling alterations.”</p>

<p>“Is the central figure completed yet?”</p>

<p>“Not quite finished. I did not feel sure about
the left leg, and I shall make some studies before I
paint it in.”</p>

<p>“If you have any difficulty with that portion of
the figure, why not omit it? Put in a bush, or a
stone, or the trunk of a fallen tree, so as to hide
the leg. Congress will accept it all the same.”</p>

<p>“Art scorns such devices. And, besides, it
would be rather too ridiculous to represent Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
standing astride of a log while he is cutting
down a cherry-tree.”</p>

<p>“True! true! That did not occur to me. What
you really want is a good model. I think I could
recommend one.”</p>

<p>“I have one already, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! A plaster of Paris one?”</p>

<p>“No; a real one.”</p>

<p>“A real one?”</p>

<p>“The property of a friend of mine; a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“On or off?”</p>

<p>“Off.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That seems to me—a—a—rather a
queer offering to a lady.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“I am a plain man, not used to flattering women,
but if I wished to express my regard for a lady I
would offer her my heart instead of my leg.”</p>

<p>“It would be dreadful if the lady happened not
to want any portion of you, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but suppose I should offer her the Pottawatomie
Reservation besides, do you think she
would refuse?”</p>

<p>“You had better undertake the investigation
yourself. How can I know?”</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> undertake it now. I offer my heart to
<em>you</em>! I offer the Reservation also. I love you, Pandora.
Oh, how I love you! Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith, it is impossible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
“No, not impossible, Pandora. Not impossible.
Do not say that; it will kill me. Listen! Have
you ever dreamed of a home upon the wide and
boundless prairie? A sweet little home, two
stories and an attic, painted white with green
shutters, where you can see eighteen miles in a
straight line, where two hundred acres in potatoes
lie beneath your very window, and where you can
hunt the bounding buffalo and the prairie-hen
without going off the estate; and where copper-colored
servant girls can be had for two dollars a
month and found? Have you ever dreamed of such
a home?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“It is to it I would bear you as my bride. Come
with me! Be mine! I cannot offer you the
enervating luxuries of the depraved and decaying
East, but together we can feast upon jerked beef
and buffalo tongues; together we can drink draughts
from the Artesian well in the cellar; together we
will sit beneath the tree by the front door, the only
one within twenty-seven miles, and together we can
watch the dog chasing the jackass-rabbits across
the sage brush. Be mine, and I will stock the
pantry with rations from the nearest Indian agency,
where I have a friend; I will buy you a suave and
gentle mule for you to exercise yourself on, and you
may have canvas enough to paint General Washingtons
and Lord Cornwallises as high as church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
steeples, and I will guarantee that Congress shall
bid them in as fast as you turn them out. Will you,
Pandora? Do you like the promise? Oh, say that
you love me!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith, I cannot. I am very sorry, but to
tell the truth plainly, I am engaged to another
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“To Dunwoody?”</p>

<p>“I did not mention his name, sir.”</p>

<p>“But I know him! A one-legged Major! And
you refuse me for him?”</p>

<p>“I refuse you; that is enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, Miss M’Duffy. I understand
you. I will bid you a very good evening. I hope
you will not have occasion to regret your decision.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I shall not! Good evening, sir!”</p>

<p>As Achilles passed out through the hall he
encountered Major Dunwoody, who was just placing
his hat upon the rack. Achilles looked back at him
for a second, scowling with rage and mortification,
and then as he rushed into the open air, he said to
<span class="locked">himself,—</span></p>

<p>“Never mind, you hopping, mud-headed, military
humbug. I’ll settle <em>your</em> case before you’re many
days older.”</p>

<p>And then Mr. Smith went home to bed.</p>

<p>Pandora greeted the Major with a joyful smile.</p>

<p>“Darling,” said the Major, “who was that person
I passed in the hall as I came in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
“That was Achilles Smith, the man of whom I
told you. He proposed to me a few moments before
you came in.”</p>

<p>“He did, did he?” exclaimed the Major savagely.
“I wish I had known it. I would have kicked him
down the steps.”</p>

<p>“But how could you, dearest, with only one
leg?”</p>

<p>“True!” said the Major. “But I could have
thrashed him with my cane. So he wants to marry
you, does he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and mother thinks I ought to accept him.”</p>

<p>“And you have firmly made up your mind to
marry me?” asked the Major, fondly.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Pandora, with a roguish smile,
“but only when you have succeeded in getting for
me your disconnected leg. You will try to get it
for me soon, Henry, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am trying now, my sweet. Colonel Dabney,
of the Maine delegation, has already introduced to
the House of Representatives a bill appropriating
my leg to me.”</p>

<p>“How splendid!”</p>

<p>“And he says it will pass promptly, so that I
can obtain the leg within less than two months.
We’ll be married right off then, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“At once. But I’m afraid, Henry, Mr. Smith
and General Belcher will oppose Colonel Dabney’s
bill if they hear of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
“I’ll brain both of them if they do,” said the
Major. “No, I won’t brain Smith; he has no
brains. And now, Pandora, darling, let us talk of
something else. Are you sure, my dearest, that
you love me <em>very</em>, very, <em>very</em> much?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Henry! ten thousand, thousand times more
than I can ever tell you. I—”</p>

<p>A person passing the parlor door at this juncture
might have heard a sharp sound resembling somewhat
that made by the tearing of a piece of muslin.
The conversation need not be quoted at greater
length. It appeared to give the most intense
pleasure to the Major and Pandora, but talk of that
kind is usually rather dreary for outside parties; so
we will lower the curtain here.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_286.png" width="66" height="68" alt="A" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword in02">About</span> a week later, Colonel Dabney reported,
with a favorable recommendation
to the House, from the Committee on Public
Property, “An Act restoring a certain amputated
limb in the Medical Museum to Major Henry
G. Dunwoody.” The Act specified the leg contained
in Exhibit 1307, Case 25, as the property to
be restored.</p>

<p>When the bill came up for discussion, General
Belcher moved to lay it upon the table. Defeated.
Then he moved to amend it with a provision that
the bone of the leg should be withdrawn and
retained in the Museum. Rejected. Then he
offered a resolution referring the whole matter to a
committee of inquiry, which should be directed to
sit for two years, and to take testimony as to what
had been the practice of governments in the matter
of surrendering legs blown off in battle, from
the time of Sennacherib down to the battle of
Sedan, including evidence respecting the custom
in Persia, Greece, Egypt, Rome, Carthage, Palestine,
and modern Europe. After a spirited debate
the resolution was lost. But the General was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
discouraged. He presented another resolution,
that a special committee be directed to inquire
whether the person mentioned in this bill was the
same Major Dunwoody who, in a fit of alcoholic
frenzy, in Clarion County, Pennsylvania, in 1866,
treed his aged grandfather one rainy night, and
compelled that venerable and rheumatic person to
roost upon a lofty branch until morning. Voted
down: Yeas 304; Nays 1 (General Belcher).</p>

<p>The bill finally passed to a third reading, and
was adopted. When it had received the approval
of the Senate and the President, Major Dunwoody
drove round to the Museum in high glee with Pandora.
He carried in his pocket an empty pillow-case,
in which he proposed to take home with him
the long-lost fragment of himself. When he found
the janitor and presented his credentials, that official
was exceedingly polite, and at once led the
way to the place where the treasure was kept.</p>

<p>While he was unlocking the case, Pandora could
hardly repress her feelings of joy. Leaning upon
her lover’s arm, and watching the janitor, she <span class="locked">exclaimed,—</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it elegant, dear? I can hardly realize
that we are really going to get it! Mother will
be so glad when George Washington has his other
leg on.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had <em>my</em> other one on,” said the Major,
pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
“So do I. It’s too bad! But you can stand it
up on the table and look at it now as much as you
want to, can’t you, darling?”</p>

<p>The janitor lifted down the huge jar containing
the limb, and took it out of the spirits.</p>

<p>“I feel,” said the Major, as he unfolded his
pillow-case, “as if I was in a cemetery, disinterring
one of my near relations.”</p>

<p>“So beautiful! Isn’t it?” said Pandora.</p>

<p>The Major suddenly scrutinized the leg closely.</p>

<p>“Why, how—how’s this? I don’t exactly understand—let’s
see, janitor, this is Exhibit 1307?
Yes. Case 25? Yes, Case 25; so it is. Why,
Thunder and Mars! (excuse my agitation, Pandora,)
there must be something wrong about
this!”</p>

<p>“Wrong, Henry? How?”</p>

<p>“Guess not, sir,” said the janitor. “This is what
the bill calls for.”</p>

<p>“But it can’t be, you know. I lost my left leg,
and this one you had in the jar here is a right leg.
I couldn’t have had two right legs, Pandora, of
course!”</p>

<p>“I do not know, dear. Some persons have peculiarities
of formation which—”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, now, be reasonable. I am absolutely
certain that my leg was a left leg in every particular.
You see, Pandora, this is a matter about
which I may fairly be considered an authority.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
“Yes, Henry, but—but maybe being in the
alcohol so long may have changed it.”</p>

<p>“Impossible. Quite impossible, Pandora. The
annals of medical science, from Esculapius down,
contain no record of such a thing. The leg is not
mine.”</p>

<p>“But you might as well take it, dearest, mightn’t
you, because my George Washington ought to be
finished as quickly as possible?”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to put two right legs on him,
too, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Henry, I might. People won’t
look at his toes; and if they did, they would regard
the arrangement as one of the eccentricities of
genius, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Let us look about,” said the Major. “Perhaps
my leg is in one of these other cases. Why, here
it is! Sure enough! In Case 1236, Exhibit 11.
That is mine. You’ll let me have it, Mr. Janitor,
of course?”</p>

<p>“Can’t do it, sir; I have to follow the Act of
Congress carefully. I daren’t go outside of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is too bad!” exclaimed the Major.
“You positively won’t give it to me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Pandora, there is nothing to do but
to wait. I’ll get Colonel Dabney to put another
bill through at once. Let me get the numbers:
Exhibit 11, Case 1236.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Then, taking Pandora upon his arm, the Major
hobbled to his carriage and drove straight to the
Capitol.</p>

<p>About three weeks later another bill passed the
House without opposition, General Belcher being
absent in New York upon a Committee of Inquiry.
While the measure was pending in the Senate,
Achilles Smith, one morning, at an early hour, entered
a rear door of the Museum with a key which
he had obtained by bribing the charwoman, and
proceeding to Case 1236, he removed the leg from
the jar No. 11, and put it in another jar in another
case, replacing it with the leg that had been in the
latter jar.</p>

<p>He went down-stairs chuckling. “You mutilated
outcast, you,” he said, addressing the Major in
imagination; “we’ll see who’ll beat at this game!”</p>

<p>When the Act had been signed by the President,
the Major drove with Pandora to the Museum a
second time. Upon reaching Case 1236 he was
for a moment stricken dumb with amazement.
Presently he <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Why, Pandora, my dear, do you see? It’s the
leg of a colored man!”</p>

<p>“Ye—e—es, it seems to be, Henry. But perhaps
mortification or something has set in.”</p>

<p>“It is very mysterious. I can’t account for it.”</p>

<p>“One of your legs was not colored, was it, my
love?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
“Oh, no, of course not!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the janitor here has tarred it over, to
preserve it better?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; that’s not allowed in this institution.”</p>

<p>“You’ll take it anyhow; won’t you, Henry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, be reasonable. Take the leg of a
negro for mine!”</p>

<p>“Well, but, Henry, I can paint it white in my
picture.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, Pandora, you know we won’t care
to have particles of fractured Africans scattered
about our house. We can have no cherished memories
associated with a leg like this.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not; but it seems rather hard that
my Washington should have to stand upon that
one leg at least a month longer.”</p>

<p>“He won’t mind it. He was heroic. He would
have stood upon a solitary leg for centuries rather
than have robbed another man of his members.”</p>

<p>Pandora sighed deeply, and made up her mind
to try to be resigned; and so they went downstairs,
and drove away to state the case to Colonel
Dabney.</p>

<p>The Colonel, after hearing the story, distinctly
affirmed the opinion that there had been foul play.
The Major jumped at the suggestion, and told him
of General Belcher and Achilles Smith, and their
designs respecting Pandora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
“Never mind; I will defeat their plans,” said
the Colonel. “You shall have the leg next time,
if it is still in existence, no matter who meddles
with it.”</p>

<p>The next Act reported by Colonel Dabney provided
that Major Henry G. Dunwoody should have
authority to take possession of his leg wherever it
could be found, in any institution under control of
the Government.</p>

<p>General Belcher made a long and eloquent
speech in opposition to the bill.</p>

<p>He referred to the heroes of the past. Who
ever heard of Epaminondas prowling about in
search of a leg lost in honorable warfare? Did
Leonidas return from Thermopylæ to seek the aid
of the national legislature in an effort to recover
members of his body that had been hacked off?
Hannibal was fairly torn to pieces, but he would
have scorned to go fishing in alcohol jars for them.
Cæsar, Alexander, Wallenstein, Wellington, General
Jackson, were all mighty warriors, but he had
yet to learn that they ever stooped to begging
their respective governments for mangled remains
that had been preserved for the instruction of
medical men and the alleviation of the sufferings
of the human race. No, it was reserved for this
obscure American militiaman, who was gravely
suspected of fiendish barbarity to an aged and infirm
grandsire, and who had been charged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
hiding behind a baggage-wagon at Gettysburg, to
begin this ghoulish practice of grasping for legs
that had been solemnly dedicated to the uses of
our common country.</p>

<p>He would direct attention to the remarkable and
mysterious circumstances surrounding this case.
It was admitted even by the friends of Major Dunwoody
that he had <em>one</em> leg. Two other legs had
been awarded him by separate Acts of Congress.
That made three. He had in his hand a receipt
for two artificial legs supplied to Major Dunwoody
by the Government, making five; and he was
credibly informed that the Major had recently
appeared at a church in the capital wearing a
French leg, with which he performed some extraordinary,
not to say scandalous, feats during the
service. Thus there was positive evidence that
this person had already in his possession six legs,
and now he was demanding from Congress permission
to take a seventh. He appealed to the
House, was it reasonable that one man should be
allowed to have seven legs? Would it look well
for this House to announce to the country that it
was willing to rifle the Medical Museum in order
to confer an additional leg upon a man who was
the owner of six others? He could understand
such legislation if men were constructed like centipedes,
but it seemed to him more than monstrous,
positively iniquitous, indeed, to vote away the pathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and instructive remnants of our glorious
heroes for the purpose of furthering the insidious,
perhaps treasonable, designs of a man who had
enough legs of various kinds already to make three
ordinary men comfortable.</p>

<p>When the General concluded his remarks, Colonel
Dabney replied, and stated the facts of the case
plainly and forcibly. The bill was passed by a
handsome majority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_295.png" width="66" height="68" alt="U" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">Upon</span> the very same day, General Belcher’s
Act indemnifying Achilles Smith for the
loss of his scalp by removing the Pottawatomie
Indians from their reservation, was
squeezed through the House by a majority of two
votes. The bill provided for the immediate withdrawal
of the Indians from their reservation in the
Indian Territory, and the location of the tribe
upon another reservation in Colorado, in a part of
the country which is absolutely a desert, without
water or shrubbery, and wholly unfit for the residence
of any animal of a higher grade than a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>By some means the information of the action of
the House was conveyed to the Pottawatomie chiefs,
and they expressed to their agent their disgust in
very strong language. The agent was scared, and
he sent to Fort Gibson for a company of cavalry to
protect him. The commander could spare but ten
men. When the Indians discovered the approach
of the soldiers they imagined that a force was coming
to drive them from their homes, and accordingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
they attacked the squad, killed all but one
man, and then the entire tribe went upon the
warpath.</p>

<p>The Government took instant action. The Indians
numbered about one thousand warriors. The
force sent to crush them included not more than
two hundred cavalrymen. The Indians were
mounted upon fleet and hardy ponies, which could
endure an incredible amount of fatigue and live
upon grass. The cavalrymen bestrode horses which
had performed service in New York omnibuses
and upon St. Louis horse-cars, and which could
hardly be driven faster than six miles an hour under
stress. The Indians were armed with telescope
rifles, breech-loading, and warranted to kill at
three-quarters of a mile. These had been furnished
gratuitously in time of peace by a beneficent
Government. The soldiers were armed with
short-range carbines, and with sabres which were
about as useful in fighting savages who never came
within gun-shot as a fishing-rod would have been.
The Indians carried upon their ponies what food
they wanted. The military force was encumbered
by ambulances and several wagons carrying camp
equipage. In a fight at close quarters the soldiers
could have beaten their adversaries easily. In a
race, which permitted no other fighting than occasional
skirmishing, all the chances were on the
side of the Indians; and a race was what the combatants
were in for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Just before the expedition was ready to start,
General Belcher, by bringing some influence indirectly
to bear, succeeded in having Major Dunwoody
detailed to accompany it in command of the
Commissary Department. The Major was wild with
vexation and disgust.</p>

<p>“Pandora, darling,” he said, “you know that I
was to get my leg to-morrow, and that we were to
be married within the month?”</p>

<p>“Well! Won’t we? Is anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“Wrong! Why, my dear, I have just received
from the War Department orders to accompany
the expedition against the Pottawatomies. I start
to-morrow for Fort Gibson.”</p>

<p>“How can you ride, with only one leg?”</p>

<p>“I am to command the Commissary Department.
I shall have to ride in an ambulance. This
is the fault of that accursed Smith. Why didn’t
he and Belcher let the Indians alone?”</p>

<p>“And we can’t be married, then, until you
return?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how. Isn’t it outrageous? I have
the worst luck of any man in the army.”</p>

<p>Pandora looked as if she were going to cry.</p>

<p>“And your leg? Won’t you get that until you
come back?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I will take it out of the Museum
this evening, and you can amuse yourself throwing
it upon the canvas while I am gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
“Oh, that will be so nice!”</p>

<p>“So nice that I am gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Henry! How could you think I meant
that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t; I was only jesting. And you will
think of me sometimes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes; every moment of the day.”</p>

<p>“And you love me very much?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, indeed, I do!”</p>

<p>“My darling!”</p>

<p>“My dearest!”</p>

<p>Probably the curtain might as well drop again at
this point.</p>

<p>The expedition started from Fort Gibson. It
marched straight across the Indian territory to
the Pottawatomie Reservation. The savages had
moved off, about a day’s march ahead of the soldiers,
toward the northwest. The military pressed
forward; the Indians kept always just a little in advance.
The two forces crossed into Kansas. The
troops pressed their omnibus horses a little harder,
and came within sight of the Indian rear-guard.
Then the savages spurred up and increased the interval
between them and the pursuers.</p>

<p>The Pottawatomies headed for Colorado, and
crossed the line in a few days, with the soldiers the
usual distance behind. Just after passing the Colorado
border, the Colonel commanding resolved to
steal a march upon the foe. One night, instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
going into camp, he pressed on until twelve o’clock,
and then halted upon the bank of the Arkansas
River.</p>

<p>Four omnibus horses succumbed under the
strain, and ere morning dawned some Pottawatomies
crept into the camp and stole six mules.</p>

<p>The most degraded Indian was never known to
steal a New York omnibus horse, even in the dark.</p>

<p>The next day the four dismounted troopers were
placed in an ambulance, and the pursuit began
again. The Indians fled up through Colorado into
Wyoming Territory, and the Colonel commanding
pushed after them, going faster and faster every
day. By the time he reached Fort Russel, just
over the edge of the Wyoming line, the route of
his march was marked with a succession of omnibus
and car horses in various stages of decay. At
the Fort he obtained fresh horses, and sacrificing
the baggage wagons, keeping only the ambulances,
he pressed on.</p>

<p>On the 27th of August his scouts discovered the
Indians in camp in a valley a few miles ahead.
The Colonel resolved upon a surprise. When
everything was arranged the troops charged down
upon the village with a wild hurrah. Not an Indian
could be seen. The soldiers, however, burned the
lodges and withdrew. Upon their return they
found that in their absence the Indians had stampeded
their mules and all their ambulances but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
one, which Major Dunwoody had saved by hard
driving.</p>

<p>The chase was resumed with greater heat than
ever. So far there had not been a chance for anything
like a fight. In fact, not a dozen savages had
been seen.</p>

<p>Within a week or two Wyoming was traversed
and Montana Territory reached. There, just beyond
the Crow Indian Reservation, the first Pottawatomie
of the campaign was slain. He sneaked
into the camp one night, and while cutting loose
one of Major Dunwoody’s mules, the mule kicked
him upon the head and killed him.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October the soldiers had marched
for thirty-six hours without rest, and it was believed
that they would at last strike a telling blow upon
the savages. Everything was ready for a fight, and
the troops were full of eagerness for the fray.
While they were halting for water upon a small
creek, a friendly Gros Ventre Indian came in with
the information that the fugitive Pottawatomies had
crossed the British line and were now safe from
pursuit within the dominions of Her Majesty.</p>

<p>The Colonel and his officers and men fairly tore
the English language into shreds in their efforts to
express with the necessary emphasis their appreciation
of the facts of the situation.</p>

<p>The “war” cost the Government a little less
than a million and a half dollars, omnibus horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
included; and it was estimated by well-informed
persons that the flying Indians, while upon the
route, destroyed private property to the amount of
half a million more, besides killing and scalping a
party of eighteen emigrants which was passing
through Wyoming.</p>

<p>It seemed like rather a large price to pay for
Mr. Achilles Smith’s scalp.</p>

<p>Some time during the month of September,
while the chase was in progress, Achilles called at
the house of Mrs. M’Duffy in Washington and
asked for Pandora. He <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Miss M’Duffy, I come upon a somewhat painful
errand, but I have a duty devolving upon me,
and I must perform it.”</p>

<p>“No bad news from Major Dunwoody, I hope,
Mr. Smith?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say there is.”</p>

<p>Pandora’s eyes filled with tears. Her face became
pale.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have here a dispatch to the Secretary of War,
saying that in a fight with the Indians, on last
Wednesday week, Major Dunwoody—”</p>

<p>“Not killed! Oh, please don’t say he was slain!
I can’t bear it.”</p>

<p>“No, not killed. Major Dunwoody has lost his
other leg and his right arm.”</p>

<p>“How terrible!” screamed Pandora; then she
wept bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
“Terrible, indeed!” replied Smith in a sympathetic
tone. “But you know this is the fortune of
war. This it is to be a soldier.”</p>

<p>“Poor Henry! How he must have suffered! Do
you know how he is? What are the chances of
recovery?”</p>

<p>“The dispatch says he is doing very well. But
of course he will be a mere wreck.”</p>

<p>“It is dreadful, too dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Perfectly helpless, too. A mere burden upon
those who will have to take care of him.”</p>

<p>“Not if they love him!”</p>

<p>“But surely you—you do not intend to cling to
such a—a—such a disintegrated ruin as he?”</p>

<p>“I shall be true to him unto death.”</p>

<p>“I had hoped,” said Achilles sadly, “that now
that Dunwoody is reduced to about one half his
original dimensions, I might hope to have you consider
my claims.”</p>

<p>“Never! It can never be!”</p>

<p>“Because I am about moving out on the Pottawatomie
Reservation, and with you as my bride I
could make it a little paradise here below. If you
will take me, the Reservation is yours in fee-simple.”</p>

<p>“I scorn the offer, sir!”</p>

<p>“You scorn it, do you? Scorn the most splendid
tract of land in the Mississippi Valley for the sake
of marrying half of a man, whom you’ll have to
carry to church in a market basket and to feed
with a spoon!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
“Yes, sir. I scorn it and you. For to you and
your wicked schemes against the unoffending
Indians, this awful, this dreadful suffering of Major
Dunwoody is due. I hate you! Yes, I hate you!
Leave the house this instant, sir!”</p>

<p>Smith withdrew, and as he closed the door
Pandora fell upon the sofa and cried as if her poor
little heart would break.</p>

<p>Enter Mrs. M’Duffy.</p>

<p>“Pandora, my child, what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t that horrid Smith tell you?”</p>

<p>“What horrid Smith? I don’t know any such
person. If you mean Mr. Achilles Smith, why, he
didn’t tell me anything. I have not seen him.”</p>

<p>“Poor Major Dunwoody has had his arm shot
off.”</p>

<p>“What! Not another limb lost! Why, the man
is falling apart in sections.”</p>

<p>“And that’s not the worst of it.”</p>

<p>“Not the worst? Why, my child, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“His other leg has been amputated.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, that’s agreeable news. No
legs and only one arm. Pity they didn’t amputate
his head at once. I suppose, of course, you will
break your engagement?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! How can you be so unkind?”</p>

<p>“Pandora M’Duffy, you must be insane. Marry
a man with only one limb. How is he going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
waddle around? Do you intend to carry him
under your arm, in a bundle?”</p>

<p>“He will go on wheels, of course,” said Pandora
with brimming eyes.</p>

<p>“On wheels! A Hunsicker and a M’Duffy
married to a man on wheels, and who has to slide
on the banister when he wants to come downstairs!
Why don’t you accept Mr. Smith at once?
He is intact, I believe, with the exception of his
scalp. This family seems to be haunted by men
who are more or less in piecemeal.”</p>

<p>“I would rather die than marry Smith.”</p>

<p>“You might do it for your mother’s sake, so as
to be near to her.”</p>

<p>“Near to her? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, I came in to tell you, my child, that I
have accepted General Belcher’s hand. I shall
marry him, and we shall probably spend our
summers at his prospective country seat upon the
Pottawatomie Reservation.”</p>

<p>“General Belcher!” exclaimed Pandora in disgust;
“I never thought, mother, it would come to
<em>that</em>!”</p>

<p>Then Pandora swept out of the room, with her
handkerchief to her eyes, leaving the majestic Mrs.
M’Duffy in a condition of some uncertainty as to
her daughter’s theory respecting the degree of
humiliation which had been reached in her contract
with the General.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
“But I know he is rich, and that he has a promise
of an appointment as Minister to Peru, where he
expects to speculate in bark,” said Mrs. M’Duffy to
herself.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Interior Department at that
period was an especially capable officer. He
obtained by some means a clue to the secret of the
movement against the Pottawatomie Reservation,
and he followed it industriously by means of his
agents. Late in the month of October he had
probed the matter to the bottom, and he gave it to
the newspapers.</p>

<p>The entire conspiracy of General Belcher and
Achilles Smith was exposed, and an indignant
nation discovered that the costly struggle with the
Pottawatomies had not even so slight a basis of
justice on the part of the Government as a real
injury done to Achilles Smith. It was ascertained
that Smith had not been scalped at all. He had
merely had his hair pulled at the Pottawatomie
agency by a muscular squaw whom he was trying
to cheat out of her fair allowance of rations.</p>

<p>It became clear that a Congressional investigation
would be ordered before the year was out,
and Achilles Smith fled. General Belcher’s conduct
excited so much indignation at Kansas, that the
politicians, following the popular lead, turned on
him. He was arrested and tried upon a charge of
bribery, and was committed. When on his way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
prison he knocked down his custodian, took the
first horse he came to, and started due South. It is
supposed that he went to Mexico. The feeling in
Kansas is that the unhappy land of the Montezumas
has yet to experience her bitterest woes. It will
be a charming country to emigrate from when
General Belcher begins to feel at home.</p>

<p>Early in November Major Dunwoody obtained
release from his duties and came to Washington.
He had not warned Pandora; he wished to surprise
her. When he called he withheld his name from
the servant. Pandora entered the room slowly.
When she saw her lover she gave a little scream
of joy and flew towards him. Before reaching him
a thought struck her. She paused and seemed
astonished.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, darling? Aren’t you glad
to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what—what—why—Henry dear,
how is it you have your leg with you?”</p>

<p>“I always keep it by me, sweet. It is so convenient
to have it along. You have the other one,
you know.”</p>

<p>“But, Henry, you appear to have both arms, too.”</p>

<p>“I brought them to hug you with, you angel,
you.”</p>

<p>She flew into them, and after a brief moment
expended in exercising their lips, Pandora looked
up into the Major’s face and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
“You know, dear, I heard that you had lost
your other leg and one of your arms. I cried about
it for a month.”</p>

<p>“Who gave you that information?”</p>

<p>“That scandalous story-teller, Achilles Smith.”</p>

<p>“Smith, hey! Is he still around? That young
man is actually suffering for somebody to macerate
him.”</p>

<p>“And you’re not hurt a bit, are you, deary?”</p>

<p>“I am a little dyspeptic from too regular dieting
upon salt pork so tough that it creaked when I
swallowed it; but that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Henry, you don’t know how glad I am!”</p>

<p>More osculatory exercise at this juncture; but we
will not stop to consider it, satisfactory as it
appeared to be.</p>

<p>“And now, my love,” said the Major, as they
sat together on the sofa, the Major’s right arm
encircling Pandora’s waist, “tell me about everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me see. First of all—you know,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, she is going to marry Colonel Dabney.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she <em>was</em> engaged to General Belcher,
but—”</p>

<p>“Not old Belcher of Kansas?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but he proved a rascal, so she discarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
him, and now she is engaged to Colonel Dabney.
Splendid, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly splendid. By the way, have you
copied my off leg yet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; long ago.”</p>

<p>“Then your picture is done?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Henry dear, but—”</p>

<p>“What! Isn’t it satisfactory, after all?”</p>

<p>“It is to me, darling, but Colonel Dabney says
Congress will never accept it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“He seemed embarrassed when I asked him the
reason, and he turned the subject.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely hopeless, is it?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Dabney says so.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dear; what do you think?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you alter it into something else?”</p>

<p>“I thought of that. It occurred to me that maybe
I might turn it into the Execution of Mary Queen
of Scots and get the Canadian Government to buy
it.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea.”</p>

<p>“Paint in different clothes, you know, on Washington,
and fix up the tree somehow into Mary Queen
of Scots. I think the hatchet will do as it is—do
for the executioner’s axe, you know.”</p>

<p>“I see. It’s a good notion.”</p>

<p>“Mother said she thought I might make it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
battle between a Crusader and a Saracen, but the
tree is in the wrong position for a person supposed
to be fighting.”</p>

<p>“Won’t do at all, of course.”</p>

<p>“When General Belcher was here he said he
believed that by painting the grass red so as to
represent fire, and making a mast with rigging out
of the tree, it might pass for the Boy who stood on
the Burning Deck—Casabianca. But the Canadian
Government would not care particularly about the
Boy who stood on the Burning Deck, would they,
Henry?”</p>

<p>“I have a dim idea that they wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll stick to Mary Queen of Scots.”</p>

<p>“And now about our wedding?”</p>

<p>“I’m ready.”</p>

<p>“Name the day.”</p>

<p>“Will next Thursday do?”</p>

<p>“Admirable. So, next Thursday you will be my
darling wife.”</p>

<p>“And you will be my sweet, splendid husband.”</p>

<p>“Pandora!”</p>

<p>“Henry!”</p>

<p>Another fall of the curtain appears to be necessary
just here. We will ring it down. If it could
have been raised again a glimpse might have been
caught of a pretty room in which sat a lovely and
smiling woman by the side of a table, sewing. Close
to her sat a handsome young soldier, with one leg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
upon the floor. His other leg bobbed about in a
huge jar that rested in a corner. Pandora M’Duffy
had been transformed into Mrs. Major Henry G.
Dunwoody, and she was happy.</p>

<h2 id="JINNIE">“JINNIE.”<br />

<span class="subhead">A STORY OF A CHILD.</span></h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_311.png" width="66" height="68" alt="J" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">“Jinnie!</span> Vir-r-rginia-a-a! You ‘Jin’! If
you’re not here in a minute, I’ll whip you
within an inch of your life!”</p>

<p>It was the shrill voice of Mrs. Tyke. Down
from some mysterious part of the recesses of the
house it came with the force and precision of a
rifle-ball, through the narrow hall and open door to
the ears of Jinnie, who was scrubbing the front
steps.</p>

<p>Why Mrs. Tyke desired that the steps and the
pavement should be scrubbed upon that cold and
dismal December morning cannot be imagined.
Probably she herself could not have given a reason
for it if she had been asked. The bricks looked
very clean and wholesome before the work began,
and the marble steps were almost painfully white.
Now, the pavement was covered with a film of ice
upon which pedestrians slipped and were provoked
to anger, and the steps were positively so icy as to
be unfit for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
The voice of Mrs. Tyke gave fresh impetus to
the arm of the child, who was just giving a few finishing
wipes to the uppermost step. She was a
little child, surely not more than eight years of age.
As she knelt upon the marble, rather painful prominence
was given to a pair of shoes which might
once have been the property of Mrs. Tyke herself,
but which were now worn, as forlorn and riddled
wrecks, upon feet which were stockingless. The
thin little legs above the leather ruins were blue
with cold, and the tiny arms which wielded the
wiping-cloth with accelerated speed were bare and
chapped to redness.</p>

<p>If it was an offence to cover a pavement with ice
upon such a morning, it was a bitter wrong to
compel a little child so poorly clad to perform the
work.</p>

<p>Before Jinnie had replaced her cloth in her
bucket, Mrs. Tyke appeared in the doorway with
anger in her face. She took hold of one of the
child’s ears with her coarse fingers and pulled her
into the hallway head foremost with as much force
as if she had been shot out of a catapult. Then
Mrs. Tyke, with a vigorous hand, boxed the ear
that she had pulled, cuffed the other ear, impartially,
knocking the child against the wall.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you to mind me when I call you!
Pottering and fooling with your work! Now you
go right out into the yard and scrub those bricks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
in a jiffy, or you’ll know how the broom-handle
feels.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyke was going to have the back-yard
scrubbed also. Why Mrs. Tyke did not scrub the
four walls of the house, and the roof, and the chimney
flues and the fence, and why she did not scrub
the cobble-stones in the street, is an impenetrable
secret.</p>

<p>Jinnie picked up the bucket, and went staggering
through the hall, into the kitchen, with a feeling
that her head might at any moment tumble off,
as a result of Mrs. Tyke’s blows, and roll upon the
floor. She refilled her bucket at the hydrant, and
began her work with a vigor that promised to make
Mrs. Tyke’s back-yard within a few moments a fit
place for skaters.</p>

<p>Just before the work was done, Mrs. Tyke appeared
at the window with her bonnet on, and in a
severe tone gave Jinnie some directions respecting
the preparation of dinner during her absence.
Then Mrs. Tyke withdrew, and just as the front
door slammed Jinnie saw the head of a child appear
over the top of the partition fence, between
the yards of Mrs. Tyke and Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>Young Miss Brown watched Jinnie putting away
the scrubbing implements, and when Jinnie drew
near to the fence with an apparent purpose to have
some conversation, the little Brown said:</p>

<p>“It’ll pretty soon be Christmas, now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
“Will it?” said Jinnie, without manifesting any
trace of interest in the fact.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Kris Kingle is coming to our house.
Mamma said so. Does Kris Kingle come to your
house on Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever comes to our house but the milkman.
He is not Kris Kingle, is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Don’t you hang up your stockings on
Christmas eve?”</p>

<p>“I have no stockings to hang up.”</p>

<p>“Where does Kris Kingle put all your pretty
things, then?”</p>

<p>“He don’t bring me any. Who is Kris Kingle?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know? He comes in a sleigh
full of toys, pulled by reindeer, and—”</p>

<p>“Where does he come from? Ohio?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. But he comes down the chimbley
every night before Christmas, and—”</p>

<p>“I expect our chimbley must be too little. Or
maybe he don’t know we live here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he knows where everybody lives; all the
little children.”</p>

<p>“I’m <em>so</em> sorry he forgets me! Maybe it’s because
I have no stockings! Oh, I wish, I wish
I had!”</p>

<p>“Won’t Mrs. Tyke lend you one of hers?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to ask her. I wonder would Kris
Kingle come if I put a bucket there for him?”</p>

<p>“I never heard of his giving toys in a bucket.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
If he gave you a large doll maybe he would. Have
you got a large doll?”</p>

<p>“I never had any doll. I made one once out of
a dust brush and some rags, but Mrs. Tyke whipped
me and took it away. If I had a real doll I’d be so
happy that I couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Tyke whipped you for it that would
keep you from being too happy, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask your mamma to write to
Kris Kingle to come?”</p>

<p>“I never had a mamma; and no father, either.
I was born in an asylum, and Mrs. Tyke always
says it’s a pity I was ever.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’d come if you’d pray to get him.”</p>

<p>“I only know ‘Now I lay me.’ I learned it at
the asylum; but I daren’t say it out loud any
more.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we can do about it, then.”</p>

<p>Jinnie began to cry; but suddenly remembering
the imminent probability of Mrs. Tyke’s return,
she wiped her eyes with a rag of her dress,
and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Good-bye; I must go in now. I have to get
dinner.”</p>

<p>So she ran into the kitchen, and the head of the
youthful Brown slowly descended until it was
eclipsed by the fence.</p>

<p>Jinnie went to work to prepare the vegetables<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
for dinner, with her poor little brain in such a stir
of excitement about Kris Kingle and the possibility
of his remembering her or forgetting her, that
she could hardly keep her mind upon the task that
her hands were doing; but she was recalled from
her dreams by the sound of Mrs. Tyke’s step in
the hall; and as Mrs. Tyke perceived that she had
not been very industrious, Mrs. Tyke promptly
boxed her ears. She fell to the floor, and then
Mrs. Tyke kicked her two or three times. This
energetic treatment effectively dispelled all of Jinnie’s
visions of Kris Kingle. She had rarely had
any information upon which to build pleasant
thoughts of what life might have been to her; and
now when her little mind was taking its first flight
into those realms of imagination wherein so many
of the forlorn of earth find at least a taste of happiness,
the red and vigorous hand of Mrs. Tyke
hurled her back once more into the dreary and
dreadful reality of life.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day Jinnie hurried through
her myriad duties with a tremulous fear upon her
that if she should dare even to think of that mysterious
being who loved the little children she
might invoke still further blows. The blows came
at any rate, more than once, despite her carefulness;
but that was always a part of her experience,
and she bore them perhaps a little better
now because she was looking forward with a faint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
suggestion of happiness to the night, when she
should lie beneath the scant covering of her bed,
and think without fear of harm of the reindeer and
sleigh and the toys of the kind old man, who might
perhaps not forget her this time.</p>

<p>When supper-time came Mrs. Tyke ordered her
to go to the baker’s for bread. The shop to which
she had been accustomed to go was closed, for
some reason, and Jinnie sought another, upon
another street. On her way home through the
dusky thoroughfare she came suddenly upon a show-window
brilliantly lighted, and filled with childish
splendors belonging to the Christmas season.</p>

<p>She had never seen so many beautiful things
before. There were toys of all kinds, some of
which she understood and some of which were all
the more fascinating for the mystery that surrounded
them. There were wagons and horses,
and miniature tea-sets, and pop-guns, and baby
houses, and jumping-jacks, and railroad cars, and
tin steamboats, and make-believe soldier caps; and
these were mingled with clusters of glass balls of
various colors, which glittered in the gaslight in a
most wonderful manner. But the glory of the
window was a huge waxen doll dressed as a bride,
in pure white, with a veil and a wreath and the
loveliest satin dress. She had real golden hair and
the softest blue eyes, that stared and stared as
though they were looking into some other surprising
show-window over the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Jinnie trembled when she saw this marvellous
doll. She had no idea that anybody ever wore
such wonderful clothing as that. She had never
dreamed that anything could be so beautiful. She
thought she would be perfectly happy if she could
stand there and gaze at it during the remainder of
her life. Oh, if Kris Kingle would come and
leave her such a doll as that! No, that could not
be; it was impossible that she should ever have
such a joyful experience. But maybe he might
bring her a doll like some of the smaller and less
splendid ones which surrounded the bride in swarms.
Yes, she would be satisfied with the very poorest
one of them. She would hide it somewhere, under
her bed covering, perhaps, where Mrs. Tyke could
not see it, but where she could find it and kiss it
and hug it and take it close in her arms when she
went to sleep at night.</p>

<p>The thought of Mrs. Tyke came to her like a
blow in the midst of her delight. She remembered
that she must hurry homeward, and so taking
a last, long look she turned and ran along the
pavement, her heart filled with a wild, passionate
longing that Kris Kingle would come to her and
bring her something she could love.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Tyke greeted her with angry
words and two or three savage thumps. She expected
that. But Mrs. Tyke was not content with
this. When she sat down to supper she told Jinnie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
that as she had been unusually idle and bad
that day she should go hungry to bed. Then
Mrs. Tyke ate a particularly hearty meal, with the
child watching her; and when she had finished
she sat by, growling and threatening, while Jinnie
cleared away the tea-things preparatory to being
marched off to bed.</p>

<p>Jinnie missed her supper sadly, but she did not
mind the hunger so much on that night, for her
mind was busy with new delights.</p>

<p>It was dark in her room, but she knew where
the chimney was; and before she undressed she
went over and felt it. There was a hole there for
a stove-pipe, but it had paper pasted over it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Jinnie, “Kris Kingle did not
come because the hole was shut.”</p>

<p>He would not come down the chimney and out
into the dining-room, she knew, because he would
have to go through the stove; and that would
burn him, and his toys, too, perhaps. She thought
it might be an inducement for him to come if she
should punch a hole through the paper. She was
afraid to tear it off, afraid of Mrs. Tyke’s vengeance;
so she pushed her finger through it. Then
she undressed, and went hopefully to her bed upon
the floor.</p>

<p>But not to sleep; she was too greatly excited.
She began to wonder why it was that life was so
terrible. She never imagined that her life differed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
from those of other children. It is the peculiar
infamy of brutality to a child that the victim does
not know how to sound the cry for the help that is
almost always near to it. It accepts its lot as a
thing of course; it does not know that there are
perhaps within a few short steps of its house of
suffering hearts that would stir with wrath for its
wrongs, and that there is within reach a law which
would bring retribution upon the head of its oppressor.</p>

<p>Jinnie believed that all childhood was a time of
punishment and misery. She saw other children
playing in the street who seemed merry and joyous,
and she could not understand why they were so.
She remembered the Brown girl, also, and how she
had heard her sometimes laughing and singing.
Jinnie could not laugh and sing in her house with
Mrs. Tyke near her. She thought the other
children might be happy because they had dolls,
and because they could have their stockings filled
at Christmas time. She knew that grown-up people
were not abused as she was, but it seemed such a
long, long time to wait until she was grown up.
She felt that when she was she would be kinder to
children, and not strike them with the poker, at
any rate, as Mrs. Tyke sometimes struck her.</p>

<p>And if Kris Kingle should come down into her
room through the hole in the paper, she thought
she would like to be awake and to ask him to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
her away with him in his sleigh somewhere. As
she dwelt upon this she pictured herself going up
the chimney and then flying over the roofs behind
the reindeer, and looking back at Mrs. Tyke standing
at the window and cursing her. And so she
fell asleep and into a tangled maze of dreams,
wherein Kris Kingle, Mrs. Tyke and the doll-baby
bride were mingled in great confusion.</p>

<p>Jinnie’s first thought in the morning was the last
that she had upon the night before. But as she
hurriedly dressed herself it flashed across her mind
that as there was grave peril that Kris Kingle
might not come to her, perhaps it would make
matters surer if she should go to him.</p>

<p>The milkman, whose cry she expected every
moment, to her seemed a likely person to know
where Kris lived, and to take her there. Young
Miss Brown had rather indicated that Kris’s home
was in Ohio; but whether Ohio was a little piece up
the street or millions of miles away, or whether it
was a house or a stable or a town, she did not know.
The milkman had spoken pleasantly to her sometimes,
and he had a wagon. It was not as attractive
as a sleigh with reindeer, but she had often longed
to ride in it. She determined to speak to him.
But when he came and she opened the door with a
beating heart, he snatched the pitcher from her
hand and frowned while he filled it. He was
thinking of some offensive suggestions made by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Mrs. Tyke upon the preceding evening in reference
to his too intense partiality for water; and he
seemed so cross that Jinnie was afraid to speak to
him.</p>

<p>She came into the house again sorrowfully, but
with a strong purpose to seek some other means of
reaching Kris Kingle; and she carried this determination
with her stubbornly through all the fatigues
and hardships of the day.</p>

<p>About four o’clock in the afternoon Mrs. Tyke
went out. Jinnie felt that her time had come. She
resolved to make an effort to find Kris Kingle, to
tell him of her longing desire, and to return home
again before Mrs. Tyke got back. She put her
woollen hood upon her head, wrapped around her
shoulders the thin and faded rag which Mrs. Tyke
dignified with the name of a shawl; and then she
concluded to take a newspaper with her, so that if
Kris Kingle showed any disposition to urge the
doll-baby upon her in advance of Christmas, she
could have something to wrap it in.</p>

<p>When she came out of the house she crossed
the street so that she could notice particularly
whether there was anything in the construction of
the roof of Mrs. Tyke’s dwelling which would be
likely to discourage Kris Kingle from attempting
to reach the chimney. She saw that the roof was
much lower than the roofs of the houses upon each
side of it, and that it sloped at a sharp angle toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
the front, while they were flat. The chimney, also,
was certainly smaller than others in the vicinity,
and the conclusion reached by the child’s mind was
that Kris Kingle had probably been indisposed to
take the risks of running his sleigh upon so precipitous
a roof for the sake of descending such a
very narrow chimney.</p>

<p>This gave a fresh impulse to the child’s purpose
to visit Kris Kingle, so that she might plead with
him to make a call at Mrs. Tyke’s despite the
inconveniences of the construction of the house. It
occurred to her that she might possibly arrange for
him to come to the front door and ring the bell,
when she would come softly down stairs and open
to receive him.</p>

<p>While she thought of the matter she walked
quickly up the street, now somewhat gloomy in the
early dusk, but before she had gone far she reflected
that she ought to inquire the way to Ohio before
the darkness should come. She paused to speak
to two or three men who were hurrying by, but
evidently they thought she intended to ask alms
of them, and so they would not pause to listen to
her. She was discouraged; but at last she saw a
boy standing by a street lamp, doing nothing, and
she resolved to ask him.</p>

<p>He laughed rudely at her question and walked
away. A moment later he turned and threw a
snowball at her. It hit her in the face and hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
her badly; and her foot slipping upon the icy pavement,
she fell. A moment elapsed before she was
able to rise; but at last she got up, and although
she was cold and weak and greatly discouraged, she
thought she would press on. She might never
have so good a chance again; and if she did not
see Kris Kingle now, Christmas would come, and
he would come and go, and there would be no doll
for her.</p>

<p>While she was standing there, in a very miserable
frame of mind, a nicely dressed lady went past
her. Presently the lady turned and looked at her;
then she came back to where Jinnie stood and
spoke to her.</p>

<p>“What is your name, my child?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>“Virginia, ma’am. But Mrs. Tyke generally
calls me Jinnie.” She had never heard so sweet a
voice. It seemed so beautiful, so gentle, so full of
tender pity, that it thrilled her with a strange joy.</p>

<p>“And where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I am going out to Ohio, to see Kris Kingle.”</p>

<p>The lady smiled; but the smile faded into a look
of deep compassion, and she <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Did your mother let you come away from
home?”</p>

<p>“I have no mother. I’m a bound girl.”</p>

<p>“Who sent you to find Kris Kingle?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. He always forgets to come to our
house, so I was goin’ to put him in mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
“Don’t you get any toys or candy on Christmas?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. Mrs. Tyke won’t give me any,
and Kris Kingle forgets me. And I never tasted
candy but once.”</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Tyke the woman you live with?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Does she treat you kindly?”</p>

<p>“Whips me and knocks me down sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Will you go back to her?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, ma’am. I am going right back as soon
as I see Kris Kingle.”</p>

<p>The lady took her hand and resolved to go back
with her, and to see the terrible Mrs. Tyke. She
told Jinnie so, and Jinnie submitted, although she
was grieved to forego her errand.</p>

<p>“Do you know who Kris Kingle really is?” the
lady asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; he brings nice things down the chimbley
to children.”</p>

<p>“He does better things than that, my dear. The
real Kris Kingle is the Christ-child.”</p>

<p>“Who is He?”</p>

<p>“Did you never hear anybody tell of Christ?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“He is God. He came down here to live upon
earth, where He suffered and died for us. He
loved little children, for He was Himself once a
child.”</p>

<p>“Was He little, like me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How did He suffer?”</p>

<p>“Wicked men insulted Him and beat Him and
killed Him.”</p>

<p>“Did they beat Him and strike Him like they
do me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my poor child.”</p>

<p>“What makes Him love me? Because I am
beaten just like He was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is it. But He loves everybody,
good and bad.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know Mrs. Tyke, does He?”</p>

<p>“He knows everybody in the world.”</p>

<p>“Where is He now?”</p>

<p>“Up in Heaven.”</p>

<p>“Is that farther than Ohio?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is far, far away in the skies.”</p>

<p>“Then how does He get here? I always
thought the real Kris Kingle came down chimbleys.”</p>

<p>“He comes in your heart, my dear child. You
will understand it all some day.”</p>

<p>The lady seemed strangely moved as she said
this to Jinnie; but she said nothing, and led Jinnie
through the street, towards the child’s home.</p>

<p>When Jinnie and her companion reached Mrs.
Tyke’s house and rang the bell, Mrs. Tyke herself
came to the door and opened it. As soon as she
saw Jinnie she poured out at her a volley of abusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
words, without regarding the presence of the
lady who accompanied her. The lady remonstrated
with Mrs. Tyke, and then Mrs. Tyke assailed
her with her tongue. The lady then told
Mrs. Tyke that she knew of the cruel treatment to
which the child had been subjected, and that she
would interfere if it was repeated.</p>

<p>Jinnie was astonished that any one should be so
bold as to speak with so much severity to Mrs.
Tyke. The response made to this threat by Mrs.
Tyke was to seize Jinnie by the arm, to drag her
suddenly into the hallway, and to slam the door in
the lady’s face.</p>

<p>The lady stood upon the step and listened. She
could hear Mrs. Tyke beating the child and cursing
her; and then the sounds receded, as if Mrs.
Tyke were dragging Jinnie into a room at the end
of the hallway. Mrs. Tyke was in a paroxysm of
fury; and she intended to visit upon Jinnie the
vengeance she would have liked to inflict upon
Jinnie’s unknown friend.</p>

<p>Beating was too common and too tame a form
of punishment. Mrs. Tyke’s ingenuity devised a
more terrible one. She made the child remove
her shoes, and then she tied her upon a chair, with
her naked feet within a few inches of the hot
stove. In that position she left Jinnie, who bore
the frightful pain bravely, until presently she
fainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
If there is no hell, what is going to become of
people like Mrs. Tyke?</p>

<p>When Jinnie regained consciousness, Mrs. Tyke
sternly ordered her to go up to bed; and Jinnie
crawled up the staircase slowly and painfully upon
her hands and knees, suffering so much that she
could hardly help screaming aloud.</p>

<p>She reached her room at last, and flung herself
down upon the bed. Her pain was so great that it
was a long while before she could go to sleep; and
she lay there thinking with all her might about
Kris Kingle and the doll baby, and her adventures
in the street, and wondering if she would ever be
any happier. Then she remembered what little
Miss Brown had said about praying, and what the
sweet lady had told her about the Christ-child
and His wondrous love; and so she thought she
would try to pray to Him; and praying, she fell
asleep.</p>

<p>The lady who brought Jinnie home turned away
with her soul filled with indignation at Mrs. Tyke’s
cruelty to the child, and she determined to have it
ended. She knew a man, Thomas Elwood, who
was active in the service of the Society for Protecting
Children from Cruelty, and she went to his
house. He was a very plain Friend; a young
man, and of a fair countenance. He was at home
with his wife, and both expressed deep interest in
the visitor’s story. The visitor left with the assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
from Elwood that the case would receive
attention early the next morning.</p>

<p>Next morning, when Mrs. Tyke called Jinnie,
Jinnie tried to rise, but found that she could not:
she was too feeble and wretched. Mrs. Tyke saw
this, and she did not compel Jinnie to get up.
Mrs. Tyke was beginning to be frightened. So
Jinnie fell asleep again, and when she awoke it was
broad daylight, and a man with what seemed to be
an angelic face was standing beside her. It was
Thomas Elwood. Jinnie was startled; her first
impression was that this was Kris Kingle, come in
answer to her prayer. But when Jinnie looked at
the finger-hole she had made in the fire-board and
at the man, and particularly at the circumference
of his hat, it seemed to her impossible, if this was
Kris Kingle, that he should have come in by way
of Mrs. Tyke’s chimney.</p>

<p>Thomas Elwood spoke to her and asked her if
she suffered much. She said yes, and then she
asked him if he really was Kris Kingle.</p>

<p>Thomas smiled and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“No, dear child; but I am thy friend, and I am
going to take thee away from this misery and keep
thee until thee is well again.”</p>

<p>Then he lifted Jinnie in his arms, bore her downstairs
and out, and placed her in a carriage.</p>

<p>“Where is Mrs. Tyke?” thought Jinnie. Mrs.
Tyke was at a magistrate’s office, listening to Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Brown and others of the neighbors while they testified
of her brutal treatment of Jinnie. The lady
who had brought Jinnie home was there also; and
Jinnie was kindly pressed by the magistrate to tell
what Mrs. Tyke had done to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyke gave bail and went home. Thomas
Elwood took Jinnie to his own house, and his wife
wept as he told her how the child had been tortured.
She carried Jinnie upstairs and washed
her, and dressed her in clothes that Jinnie thought
were wonderful, though they were so plain. Then
she kissed Jinnie and said to <span class="locked">her,—</span></p>

<p>“I once had a little girl of thy age; but a year
ago she died. She even looked like thee, my dear.”</p>

<p>Jinnie was so weak that she had to lie upon the
bed when the washing and dressing were over;
“and such a bed!” thought Jinnie. Thomas Elwood’s
wife brought some breakfast up to her, and
Jinnie thought that she had never tasted anything
so good. She did not know that such delicious
food could be found anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Jinnie grew better and stronger in a few days,
and Thomas Elwood and his wife became so much
attached to her that they resolved that they would
keep her and adopt her in the place of the child
that had been taken away from them.</p>

<p>Jinnie was very happy, and she talked freely with
them. She told them about her search for Kris
Kingle, and about that splendid doll she saw in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
window on the night she went to the strange
baker’s.</p>

<p>Although entertaining sentiments which forbade
any enthusiasm for Christmas and Kris Kingle,
and dolls in gorgeous apparel, something impelled
Thomas Elwood to go to see that special
doll.</p>

<p>That night, as he sat with his wife in front of the
grate fire in the sitting-room, she said to him,
Jinnie being in <span class="locked">bed,—</span></p>

<p>“Thomas, does thee think there would be any
harm in giving Virginia a little pleasure on the
25th of this month?”</p>

<p>“How does thee mean, Rachel?”</p>

<p>“Well, she seems to have her little head filled
with nonsense about Kris Kingle and Christmas,
and as the poor child has had a life so full of misery,
I thought, perhaps, we might—”</p>

<p>“Thee doesn’t mean to keep Christmas in this
house, does thee?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly that, but—”</p>

<p>“What would Friends say if we should do that?”</p>

<p>“No; but there can be no harm in giving the
poor child some playthings, and we may as well
give them upon one day as another.”</p>

<p>“What kind of playthings would thee give
her?”</p>

<p>“Why not buy her a doll? She seemed to like
that doll at Thomas Smith’s store very much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
“But, Rachel, that doll was dressed in a most
worldly manner. Ought we to risk filling the
child’s mind with vain and frivolous notions about
dress?”</p>

<p>“She has hardly had a chance to feed her vanity
in that manner thus far.”</p>

<p>“Thee would be willing, then,” said Thomas, “to
buy for her that gaily-dressed doll?”</p>

<p>“I think I would; just this once.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thomas, slowly, “I am glad to hear
thee say so, because to-day I bought that very
doll.” And he produced it from a bundle that he
took from under the sofa.</p>

<p>Kris Kingle came to Jinnie that Christmas eve,
and in the morning her joy as she clasped the doll
in her arms was so great that she could not express
it. While she was at the breakfast table Thomas
Elwood was called to the parlor to see a visitor.
Presently he summoned Jinnie, and when Jinnie
came into the room she was startled to see Mrs.
Tyke. It flashed across her mind that Mrs. Tyke
had come to take her away, and she began to cry.
Thomas Elwood comforted her. Mrs. Tyke had
come to beg for mercy. She wished to escape
prosecution.</p>

<p>Thomas turned to Jinnie and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>“Virginia, this is the woman who has done thee
so much harm. I can have her punished if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
wish. What would thee do to her if thee had
thy way?”</p>

<p>“I would forgive her,” said Jinnie, timidly.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Jinnie had been visited also by
the <em>real</em> Kris Kingle. Mrs. Tyke was permitted to
go unpunished.</p>
